 HWL_Karl_Donitz:0 "Karl Dönitz"
 POLITICS_Karl_Donitz_DESC:0 "In the rusted docks of Hamburg, the Kriegsmarine makes its triumphant return at last- and at its head sits the aging Admiral, worn from years of toil and blood.\n\nKarl Dönitz is, perhaps, the last unsullied hero of the Reich. All the rest are dead, missing, or tied to the SS. The admiral who terrorized the Allies with his Wolfpacks, Dönitz has once again evaded those who wish him harm- and there are many who do in this new Germany. His family, however, has not been so lucky- his sons slaughtered in the World War, his wife passing away a few years ago, and his daughter and son-in-law almost certainly brutalized, trapped behind SS lines. His outward displays of the calm and powerful war hero, friend of Hitler and destroyer of the Reich's foes, hide the tired, beaten-down man below.\n\nIt's no wonder that the Admiral has created a council below him to deal with the pressing affairs of the day- he gives them a face, and they give him power. As such, Hamburg stands as a spot of relative calm- though the SS whirls at its doorstep, and will crush it if they can, at least someone sane is running the ship.\n\nAll is not well below decks, however, as two sides clash in the aging Admiral's head. One side, the prideful war hero, fights to stand his ground- to cement the Kriegsmarine not just as the forgotten arm of the Heer, but as a true force in Germany and an island of sanity in the storm. The other, the tired old man, wishes nothing more than to use the Kriegsmarine as a gateway north- for the refugees that crowd the city streets, and for himself. It's unclear which Dönitz will win out, but for now, the Admiral makes his last stand."

 DSG_nascent_refugee_crisis:0 "Nascent Refugee Crisis"
 DSG_nascent_refugee_crisis_desc:0 "Throughout Germany, millions flee a rapidly deteriorating situation, looking for somewhere -- anywhere to take refuge until the burning and bloodshed comes to an end. To the east lies anarchy, to the west lies hell, and to the south stands a treacherous empire which state propaganda has warned about for years. Yet there are whispers that to the north one can find their escape from this unending strife. If one can simply reach Kiel, they say that one can ferry the Baltic to Sweden.\n\nGroßadmiral Dönitz sits as the gatekeeper to these lands, and as the masses of refugees begin to increase, a decision must be made as to how to grasp the state of affairs."
 
 DSG_tiring_stance:0 "A Tiring Stance"
 DSG_tiring_stance_desc:0 "Großadmiral Dönitz took his first defiant stance against the deteriorating Reich when his personally favored successor, Martin Bormann, was denied his ascendancy into Germania. Expecting Bormann to rise triumphant over the rest of the rabble, Dönitz never foresaw the current debacle.\n\nA long time has passed since then. Returning only from his exile to seize Hamburg and Kiel to bring his defiance closer to Germania, he grows increasingly exhausted as he watches the Reich he so loved fall into utter anarchy. Has all his defiance been for naught?"
