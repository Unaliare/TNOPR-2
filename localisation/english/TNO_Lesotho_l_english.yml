Educated at Roma College in Lesotho, from a young age he cooperated closely with the South African government, just as his stepmother, acting as his regent in the wake of his father's death, had before him. Granted full independence upon assuming the throne in 1960, he has so far competently led Lesotho in cooperation with the constitutional government."
