 diplocrisis.125.t:0 "German Treachery"
 diplocrisis.125.desc:0 "It seems that the skullduggery of the German rogues knows no bounds. Our ambassador to Saudi Arabia, William A. Eddy has been killed. Already our intelligence has collected a mound evidence including leaked telegram transmissions from Berlin describing Eddy as a "problem" that needed to be "liquidated", the involvement of a pro-German ba'athist cell in planning obtaining the materials for the attack, reports by bystanders of shouting in German during the evening of the murder, and finally a knife inscribed with "Blood and Honor" left at the scene.\n\nWhile a few within our government question why the Germans would so sloppily execute the murder of so important an ambassador, the majority put it down to Nazi incompetence, and favor immediate reprisals. What's more, parts of the relevant intelligence report was leaked to the press, causing a significant public outcry. Already we have demanded that Germany explain themselves, any further actions will wait on their response."
 diplocrisis.125.a:0 "Let's see what the Huns say."

 diplocrisis.126.t:0 "The American Accusations"
 diplocrisis.126.desc:0 "It seems that the hysteria of the degenerate Americans knows no bounds. Their ambassador to Saudi Arabia, WIlliam A. Eddy has perished, most likely due to some careless accident or the malicious schemes of a Jewish-Bolshevik cell. What's more, the American government has charged our glorious Reich with orchestrating the murder, and amassed a mountain of false evidence relating us to the crime.\n\nWhile this is no doubt a pathetic attempt to tarnish our reputation at the international scale, opinion within our government is divided about how to proceed. Some have argued for a force denial and material reprisals, while others think that it's best to escalate. For now, it is best to issue a simple denial, and see what the Yankees do."
 diplocrisis.126.a:0 "Wasn't us."

 diplocrisis.127.t:0 "The German Denial"
 diplocrisis.127.desc:0 "At long last we have received the response from Germany to our accusations of their involvement in the killing of ambassador Eddy. It was short, simple, and thoroughly disappointing: "The German Reich categorically denies the American accusations, and challenges them to provide any real proof of their claims."\n\nIn response, many hardliners have advocated fortifying our embassies in the region and dispatching additional military forces to protect them. However, others within our diplomatic corps have noted that this attack is well out of line with Germany's middle eastern strategy, and did little in service to their interests. They believe that a provocation at this stage would be unwise, and could have unexpected catastrophic effects."
 diplocrisis.127.a:0 "We have to make sure our diplomats are safe. Fortify the bases."
 diplocrisis.127.b:0 "The evidence is sloppy, extend an olive branch."

 diplocrisis.128.t:0 "American Acceptance"
 diplocrisis.128.desc:0 "It seems that the Yankee fools don't have the stomach for real rough-and-tumble diplomacy. After a significant delay, the American government today sent a back-channel diplomatic note to our government admitting that the evidence for our involvement in the murder of their ambassador is scattered, sloppy, and indicative of a possible false flag operation.\n\nWhile it's certainly a relief to have this cleared up, it raises further questions over who exactly was attempting to besmirch the name of the Reich, and what are their long term aims? Was it a Judeo-Bolshevik cell as many have charged? Was it the Japanese hoping to stir up trouble? Or was it the Yankees themselves? No one can say, but until we find out all of our interests are at risk."
 diplocrisis.128.a:0 "Best we keep up our guard."

 diplocrisis.129.t:0 "The Americans Insist"
 diplocrisis.129.desc:0 "Bad news. It seems that the perfidious Americans have refused to accept our denial of involvement in Eddy's murder, and are now moving to fortify their embassies throughout the Middle East. Although they claim that these actions are merely a precaution, we must assume that the soldiers and guards rapidly being deployed to this area are not just there as part of a diplomatic mission, but to undermine our interests in the region and advance those of their American masters.\n\nWe now are faced with a choice: do we engage in a direct arms race with the Yankees and build up our bases in turn to match theirs, or do we attempt to ease tensions. Many within our diplomatic corps argue for the latter course of action, claiming that this incident is not worth instigating a major diplomatic crisis, while hardliners in our government claim that the honor of the Reich is at state, and we must demand that the Americans explain themselves."
 diplocrisis.129.a:0 "Prepare to deploy elite units, and send a diplomatic note to the Americans demanding an explanation."
 diplocrisis.129.b:0 "Issue an apology and send reparations."

 diplocrisis.130.t:0 "The Germans Give In"
 diplocrisis.130.desc:0 "Excellent news from the Middle East, it seems that the foolish Nazis have decided that they cannot contend with the might of the American Republic, and have formerly apologies for the actions of "rogue elements" within the German military, and setn reparations for the death of our ambassador. We can now safely assume that matter is at rest, and our dominance over the region significantly advanced. What's more, this incident has given us an opportunity to re-fortify and reinforce our bases, and thus defend our rising influence.\n\nSoon the German Reich will find itself decisively pushed out of the Middle East, and forced to rely solely on the dwindling oil supplies of the Pakt. Once contained, the collapse of the Nazi Empire will only be a matter of time."
 diplocrisis.130.a:0 "Another victory."

 diplocrisis.131.t:0 "The German Response"
 diplocrisis.131.desc:0 "Terrible news from the Middle East, it seems that the Germans were not intimidated by the enhanced security around our military bases, and have demanded that we prove that our intentions are non-hostile lest they respond in kind. Oncemore we are faced with a critical choice: engaging in a security arms-race with the Germans would be a major provocation, but to turn turn back at this juncture would be a humiliation.\n\nWith violence in the region rising, its very possible that continuing down this path will risk unleashing a cycle of death and violence whose end no one can foresee. On the other hand, if we cannot defend our embassies from the German menace, how long will it be before they dominate the world's oil producing regions? And from there, how long until their dark tentacles reach Westwards?"
 diplocrisis.131.a:0 "Expand embassy security even further."
 diplocrisis.131.b:0 "This has to stop. Withdraw some units from the area."

 diplocrisis.132.t:0 "The American Surrender"
 diplocrisis.132.desc:0 "At last the Yankees have shown some sense. In response to our ultimatum, the Americans have torn down their newly built concrete and barbed-wire embassy fortifications, and withdrawn some of their units from the area. This is certainly a breath of relief -- for a moment it seemed that we were in for a direct confrontation with no certain ending. What's more, this is a major blow to the prestige of the American giant. Once More the world has seen that the Jewish-Bourgiouse "democratic" establishment is no match for the fire and fury of the German Reich and Aryan Race.\n\nSoon, no doubt, we will send the Americans packing from the region, and the great power of National Socialism will control the majority of the world's Oil Supply, and thus the global balance of power."
 diplocrisis.132.a:0 "Another easy victory."

 diplocrisis.133.t:0 "America Continues Buildup"
 diplocrisis.133.desc:0 "It seems that there is no end to Yankee madness and provocation. Not content with heavily fortifying their bases, in direct violation of diplomatic protocols, they have expanded their defences even further, taking over several square blocks in multiple Middle Eastern capitals. It seems that the window for diplomacy grows ever narrower, and many militarists in our nation are demanding that we fortify our own embassy's to protect them from American treachery. However, some "realists" argue that we cannot contend the Americans hand to hand without risking a full-on war, and must now de-escalate lest we lead to the destruction of everything we hold dear."
 diplocrisis.133.a:0 "They will witness the power of the Aryan."
 diplocrisis.133.b:0 "Back down. It's not worth it."

 diplocrisis.134.t:0 "The Germans Capitulate"
 diplocrisis.134.desc:0 "The Germans continue to show that despite their great photos of power and supremacy, they are at their heart cowards. Like all fascists, their endless displays of fearsome might hide weakness and desperation. In this instance, this was manifested by their quiet withdrawal from the embassy arms race, demonstrating once more the superiority of American democracy and the free-market.\n\nWith our embassies in the Middle East now fortresses impenetrable by enemies, we are free to expand our actions in the region, dramatically increasing the ability of our allies to lay waste to the proxies of Nazism and Japanese militarism. Dominance of this crucial region, and the resources therein, will give us a significant advantage in this silent war of nations, and no doubt quickly result in the collapse of our enemies."
 diplocrisis.134.a:0 "God Bless America."

 diplocrisis.135.t:0 "German Buildup"
 diplocrisis.135.desc:0 "It seems that the Germans have not yet awoken from their racial delusions. Putting their faith in their deluded notion of "Aryanism" rather than in cold facts as we do, they appear to be attempting to fortify their military bases within the Middle East in order to counter our own build up.\n\nWhile their efforts are no doubt, in the long term, futile, for the moment they pose something of a dilemma: we could reinforce our soldiers still further and put them on high alert, but challenging the German constructions even as we maintain our own will open us up to charges of escalation and hypocrisy, while backing down will threaten our growing influence in the region. We must tread carefully, we walk along a narrow path with an abyss on either side -- do we dare to allow the world to fall to Fascism, or risk destroying it in a nuclear firestorm?"
 diplocrisis.135.a:0 "Send more men and make sure they're ready for anything."
 diplocrisis.135.b:0 "Back down. We can't risk war."

 diplocrisis.136.t:0 "American Withdrawal"
 diplocrisis.136.desc:0 "Is there a better example of Jewish hypocrisy and the weakness of bourgeois "democratic" values than the United States? Their nation struts and proclaims its greatness and prosperity, yet in every instance of real challenge, they tuck their tail between their legs and run home to hide behind their oceans. This has been demonstrated once more in our ongoing dispute related to the accidental death of Ambassador Eddy. Although the Americans were happy to stock their bases in the region full of weapons, the moment we did the same they profusely apologized and immediately scaled back their expanded defence area.\n\nOnce More we have shown the world the shallowness of American pride, and its fragility when compared to the ever-enduring iron will of the German Reich."
 diplocrisis.136.a:0 "Satisfying indeed."

 diplocrisis.137.t:0 "Escalation"
 diplocrisis.137.desc:0 "It was a day like any other at the American Egyptian embassy. The soldiers made their usual rounds, albeit more of them and better armed. They had been warned that German-aligned Ba'athists were potentially preparing an attack on the diplomatic center, and so were on high alert. They stared over the passing cityfolk, wary of every black-garbed women and milk cart, ready for bombs and hidden weapons.\n\nAll of a sudden a sudden movement caught their eye, a man in khakis with an unidentifiable object sprinting towards the embassy. Quick to react, the American soldiers opened fire, killing the attacker quickly.\n\nUnfortunately it turned out that the man was only a courier, hired by the embassy to quickly and securely carry messages to their contacts throughout the city. In typical American fashion, they have refused to recognize their mistake and are now claiming that the situation was orchestrated by the local German garrison. Their soldiers have fanned out looking for the "perpetrators" and the situation is rapidly threatening to spiral out of control."
 diplocrisis.137.a:0 "We can't back down now. Deploy our men to protect our assets."
 diplocrisis.137.b:0 "This is dangerous, withdrawn all units to our embassy and open communication."

 diplocrisis.138.t:0 "Victory"
 diplocrisis.138.desc:0 "Good news! The situation in the Middle East had seemed for a moment to be at the brink of war after American soldiers were tricked into killing a embassy courier, but the Germans have backed down and offered reparations. Our men had spread out around the city, attempting to bring the vile Huns to justice, and after the news reached us of the German withdrawal, they have surrounded the enemy embassy. Although the environment remains tense, we dominate the balance of power and will most likely leave this incident with significant geopolitical gains.\n\nWith the German power in the Middle East weakened, we have struck a terrific blow against Fascism world wide."
 diplocrisis.138.a:0 "Another win in the fight against Nazism."

 diplocrisis.139.t:0 "The Breaking Point"
 diplocrisis.139.desc:0 "Tragic news from the Middle East. American soldiers deployed throughout Cairo in order to hunt the German soldiers responsible for triggering the recent incident in which an American embassy courier was killed accidentally by our own men, have found German affiliated points in the city heavily fortified and ready to engage. Although we have arrested a number of German operatives and their Ba'athist allies, many others have eluded our grasp, driven away our raiding parties. Many soldiers have been killed, and though local authorities are desperately urging both sides to remain calm, a number of firefights between American and German units and proxy forces have continued into the night.\n\nMany within our government are furious that the decrepit Nazi empire would dare to challenge the most powerful nation within the world, and urge immediate retaliation. Others believe that the situation has escalated far out of hand, and escalating now could lead to retaliation -- perhaps even open war devastating to all mankind.\n\nThe choice is yours, Mr. President. Do we yield at this pivotal moment and demonstrate to the world that America is unwilling and unable to protect them from the fascist scourge? Or do we respond with unsparing fire and fury, risk unleashing nuclear retaliation, and be remembered as the nation that unleashed the fire of the sky upon man, brought hell upon the earth and ended the age of civilization?"
 diplocrisis.139.a:0 "We cannot back down now. May god have mercy on our souls."
 diplocrisis.139.b:0 "There's no other choice. We have to yield."

 diplocrisis.140.t:0 "Sanity Prevails"
 diplocrisis.140.desc:0 "As the world teetered on the brink of chaos, militarists in America and Germany alike advocated fire and fury, the few pacifists in each government found themselves overwhelmed by the drive to war. In the darkest hour of chaos and tension, some despised, believing that they had failed and the nuclear apocalypse was now unavoidable.\n\nBut in the midst of such insanity, those in the highest halls of power saw reason, and chose to sacrifice their pride rather than the lives of all humanity.\n\nThe Americans have backed down. After firefights between our security forces throughout the Middle East, their soldiers have returned to their bases, and a cable from the State Department has formally apologized for the incident, and offered reparations. The enormous defensive zones they had previously constructed have been turned over too local authorities, and troop reductions are scheduled. What exactly caused the Yankees to back down at the final moment we shall never know. Perhaps they were intimidated by the superior elan and racial purity of the Reich. Perhaps they simply decided that the death of one ambassador was not worth the potential destruction of all humanity.\n\nFor now, this is a victory. Our international reputation has been greatly enhanced by this diplomatic coup, and it is now the Americans who are widely seen as warmongers jingoistic savages. We can only hope that the mistakes that brought this incident so close to sparking global war will not be replicated."
 diplocrisis.140.a:0 "Thank God that's over."

 diplocrisis.141.t:0 "Beginning of the End"
 diplocrisis.141.desc:0 "Never the most stable of locales, the Middle East is seething with violence and sabotage as a result of the confrontation between America and Germany. To say that war appears imminent is no understatement -- American soldiers have been reinforced with tanks, artillery, and helicopters and are now hunting for our operatives and soldiers. Our embassies are virtually under siege, and many personnel both civilian and military have been killed. One would think that the Yankkes, with their bold statements about "world peace" and "diplomatic norms" would take it on themselves to back down and so prevent a war, but it seems that the degenerate cowards have found some ounce of courage (or madness) within their placid minds.\n\nThe American escalation very clearly gives us no choice. The lives of Aryans and the honor of the Reich is at stake, and so we have immediately dispatched reinforcements to pay the Americans back in interest for their treachery.\n\nOnly a few within our government and the Reichstag have dared to criticize the mood, and have already been arrested. One way or another, the hour is nigh. The old West is going to war with the New World, and whatever happens this earth will never be the same."
 diplocrisis.141.a:0 "The Clock Strikes 12"

 diplocrisis.142.t:0 "The Conclusion"
 diplocrisis.142.desc:0 "It has often seemed that the German victory in the Second World War was not of this world, but a bad dream that had somehow taken physical form. Ever since the never ending march of humanity towards progress has been twisted and malformed. The world's powers are suspicious and cruel, fighting petty struggles rather than working together for the common good.\n\nPerhaps there truly is no explanation for the phenomenon rather than the political leanings and institutional structures of these nations. Or perhaps the madmen and street philosophers are onto something, and the Nazi victory against thre Free World truly was an aberration, one that set humanity on a unavoidable path towards destruction.\n\nEither way, the piper has come, waiting to be paid. When we ordered our boys into the Middle East, it was with the assumption that the Germans, cowards at heart, would back down. It seems that they had made a similar prediction. Now our forces are in open battle, and any hope of peace, honorable or otherwise, has been lost. There is no time left for last minute diplomatic engagement or public appeals. The red phone's line has gone dead, the missiles will soon be on their way, and pure anarchy unleashed upon the world.\n\nWould that we could un-make our mistakes, or will the soldiers of the earth regain their sanity, but it is too late for such meanderings. The World is at War once more, and this time it is doubtful if modern civilization will survive it."
 diplocrisis.142.a:0 "Does anyone hear hoof beats?"

 diplocrisis.147.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Sum of All Fears"
 diplocrisis.147.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nApproximately forty minutes ago, a B-52 Stratofortress on a standard airborne alert patrol out of Naval Air Station Selfoss in Iceland radioed a distress signal and accompanying encrypted message. The message indicated that the aircraft's vertical stabilizer had partially broken off, and that the crew would be forced to ditch into the Norwegian Sea. Aboard the aircraft was one Mark 28 thermonuclear weapon, and as such, this incident is being classified as "Broken Arrow". There is a loose nuclear bomb out there.\n\nGiven known weather conditions and established USAF safety protocols, we believe that the crew is most likely alive and floating approximately 115 miles to the southwest of Jan Mayen Island. The wreckage of their craft, and potentially the accompanying weapon, would most likely still be visible from the air. There are no indications that the German military is presently aware of the situation, but given known German radar capabilities, it is overwhelmingly likely that this will not be the case within 24 hours' time. We recommend that relevant Navy and Air Force elements be immediately tasked to rescue and retrieval operations."
 diplocrisis.147.a:0 "So ordered."

 diplocrisis.148.t:0 "Gebrochenerpfeil: Off the Radar"
 diplocrisis.148.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nApproximately one hour ago, one of our early-warning radar stations at Wilhelmshaven reported the disappearance of an Iceland-based American B-52 bomber. The bomber was being tracked, as it was on a standard patrol over neutral waters in the Norwegian Sea. It is believed that the aircraft has most likely crashed into the ocean, with the fate of the crew currently unknown. According to analysts in the OKL Technical Office, it is highly likely that such an aircraft would be carrying at least one American thermonuclear device.\n\nGiven that such a device would have landed in neutral waters, we would be within our rights to claim it as salvage if we obtained it first. Such a discovery would yield critical insights into the American nuclear weapons program, and perhaps even give us a technical edge. Additionally, the blow to American prestige would be enormous, especially if the crew members survived and were rescued by us. We recommend that you authorize a naval and air detachment to be sent at once."
 diplocrisis.148.a:0 "Let's go get that bomb."

 diplocrisis.149.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Germans Send a Flotilla!"
 diplocrisis.149.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nPer photographs from our Key Hole reconnaissance satellites, the Kriegsmarine has dispatched a sizable flotilla of minesweepers, submarine rescue ships, and even cruisers to the approximate location of the downed B-52. Additionally, Luftwaffe aircraft have been detected in the Norwegian Sea by multiple Iceland-based radar stations. We believe that they have detected the B-52's crash, and intend to salvage the wreckage and the nuclear weapon, along with any survivors. This is an absolutely critical threat to our national security and technological capabilities.\n\nHowever, we can stop this. The CIA possesses certain backchannels within the German government. We advise that a secret message be sent to German leadership at once, demanding that they halt the flotilla so that we can rescue the crew. To do otherwise would be a blow to our national security and prestige, although it may decrease tensions. What should we do?"
 diplocrisis.149.a:0 "We can take the hit. Let them pass."
 diplocrisis.149.b:0 "Tell the Germans to back off."

 diplocrisis.150.t:0 "Gebrochenerpfeil: The Americans Let Us Pass!"
 diplocrisis.150.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nAfter a series of tense backchannel discussions between American officials and representatives of our government, we have reached a settlement. The American government has agreed to allow our flotilla to enter the Norwegian Sea and salvage their B-52 and nuclear weapon, provided that we leave any surviving crew alone. This is a massive coup for us, providing new insight into American avionics and nuclear weapons technology. Our aircraft and vessels are already approaching the likely wreck site. Within the next several days, the Reich will have triumphed in this standoff, without a shot fired!"
 diplocrisis.150.a:0 "Magnificent news!"

 diplocrisis.151.t:0 "Gebrochenerpfeil: The Americans Make Their Demands!"
 diplocrisis.151.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nIt's official. The Americans know that we know about the crashed B-52. After a series of tense backchannel discussions between American officials and representatives of our government, the Americans' demands have been made clear. They want us to withdraw our ships and aircraft from the Norwegian Sea, and to not interfere in their own efforts to salvage their bomb. Given that they were sending THEIR aircraft on patrol near OUR airspace, this is obviously a preposterous demand. However, the threat of American escalation is clear. If we carry on with this plan, we may be risking heightened tensions at best, and all-out conflict at worst. Should we withdraw our flotilla and accede to the American demand, or push on towards the intelligence coup of the decade?"
 diplocrisis.151.a:0 "Damn their threats. Full steam ahead!"
 diplocrisis.151.b:0 "We cannot start a war. Withdraw the ships."

 diplocrisis.152.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Germans Fold!"
 diplocrisis.152.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nAccording to Key Hole satellite data and our radar stations on Iceland, the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine assets that the Germans had been moving into the Norwegian Sea have withdrawn. It is clear from this information that the German government has acceded to our demand, and that they do not intend on intercepting our own rescue and salvage efforts. Evidently, they were intimidated by our resolve and did not wish to escalate the situation. Our combined Navy and Air Force task force is still en route to the crash site. With any luck, all personnel involved will be safe at home within the next 48 to 72 hours."
 diplocrisis.152.a:0 "Excellent work, everyone."

 diplocrisis.153.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Germans Push On!"
 diplocrisis.153.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nAccording to Key Hole satellite data and our radar stations on Iceland, the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine assets that the Germans had been moving into the Norwegian Sea are still on course to the B-52 crash site. This is utterly unacceptable. We need to send our naval and air assets to directly intercept the German flotilla. Such a signal would likely force the Germans to back off and accept that we will be handling the crash situation. Otherwise, we would be hurting our credibility as a superpower, and the Germans would get access to a host of our secret technical knowledge. This is to say nothing of the present risk to American life. What should we do?"
 diplocrisis.153.a:0 "Deploy the ships and stop those Germans!"
 diplocrisis.153.b:0 "We're not starting a war over that plane. Hold back."

The American government has agreed to allow our flotilla to enter the Norwegian Sea and salvage their B-52 and nuclear weapon, provided that we leave any surviving crew alone. Evidently, they were intimidated enough by our show of force and have decided the potential cost was not worth it. This is a massive coup for us, providing new insight into American avionics and nuclear weapons technology. Our aircraft and vessels are already approaching the likely wreck site.

 diplocrisis.155.t:0 "Gebrochenerpfeil: The Americans Dispatch Their Ships!"
 diplocrisis.155.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nIt appears that the American threat was not an empty one. According to our naval radar pickets, a sizable detachment of American aircraft and ships have been dispatched from bases across Iceland. Their intentions are clear. The United States means to intercept our ships and conduct their own salvage and rescue operation. This is a situation that may turn deadly serious very quickly, but our ships are still getting closer to the crash site. To turn back now would be to waste that effort and give up this unique opportunity. What should we do?"
 diplocrisis.155.a:0 "This isn't worth it. Pull our forces back."
 diplocrisis.155.b:0 "They're bluffing. Keep going."

 diplocrisis.156.t:0 "Broken Arrow: The Germans Maintain Course!"
 diplocrisis.156.desc:0 "TOP SECRET//ORCON//BROKEN ARROW\n\nOur newest analysis has provided us with sobering information: the German naval task force has maintained course to the B-52 site. There is no conceivable scenario in which the Reich is unaware of our naval forces moving into the Norwegian Sea. They're just ignoring them. Combining satellite information, radar, and known German ship speeds, we estimate that they're likely to arrive before us, giving them the chance to retrieve the wreckage, the crew, and the bomb. However, we do have a countermove available. Our ships could blockade theirs when they arrive at the crash site, preventing the Germans from leaving the area. Alternatively, we could bite the bullet and remove ourselves from these ratcheting tensions. What should we do?"
 diplocrisis.156.a:0 "The Germans won't get away!"

 diplocrisis.157.desc:0 "GEHEIM\n\nMein Führer, there is both good and bad news coming out of the Norwegian Sea. According to reports from our naval flotilla, at present speeds, our forces will almost certainly arrive at the B-52 crash site before the Americans get anywhere close. That's the good news. The bad news is that, per our radar, the American ships are preparing to establish a blockade of our flotilla. This would consist of their being arranged in a loose chain around our ships, to make any attempt on our part to break out practically impossible. Such a move would escalate tensions to their absolute breaking point, and it puts us in an incredibly dangerous position. At the same time, we are tantalizingly close to this coup. What should we do?"
 diplocrisis.157.a:0 "We cannot risk getting trapped. Pull back."

The long, slender vehicle failed to make a good first impression on the President, who at once believed the aircraft was too light. He would need more information, and fast.\n\nThe representative continued. "This baby is a new and improved U2, complete with better cameras for better recon. It's also faster than some of our recent planes, so it can go anywhere and back in no time.

We've already beaten all the information out of him that we are going to get, so we really have no use for him anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't take long for the Americans to discover his trial and they are furious, to say the least. The President himself just threatened war if we dare execute the American, but he had it coming for refusing to comply. Right now, we believe the President's remark is nothing more than an empty threat; he has no reason to instigate a war over one dead American, especially after he was sent over here in the first place.

We need to make sure the Germans know that if they execute our guy, we will send fire and fury their way posthaste. Hopefully they will recognize our might and back down, finally sending Powers back home after his painful confinement. We could also choose to back down ourselves and let Powers die, but there is no doubt our reputation will be crushed beyond repair. It would be a mistake we could never recover from, but it would save the world from an outbreak of war.\n\nThis has become a very, very tense situation.

As we proceed closer and closer to Powers's execution, the Americans are growing more and more belligerent.\n\nWe are quite unfamiliar with the current situation, and our foreign diplomats are unsure how to proceed. The best move we could make is uphold the pilot's execution; we are already so far into the crisis that we must hope the President is feigning the threat of war. However, we can still back out while we have the opportunity; though our prestige would be shattered into pieces, we could prevent a potential World War III.\n\nIt all adds up to this decision: do we continue the execution and hope the President isn't serious, or do we finally back down, hanging our heads in shame in front of the whole world?"

If things couldn't get any worse, our military is making plans to break Powers out and bring him home, but this action is incredibly risky and could start World War III. If we attack the fortress holding Powers, we would have to sacrifice our own men while killing those Nazis, and the Germans would surely retaliate. However, if we give up our man to the Germans, the American people would hate us.\n\nOur diplomats believe we made many mistakes leading up to this moment of crisis, mistakes that could have been avoided, and now we have to select the better of two horrible outcomes. One option: we let the generals finish their plans and break Powers out, killing Germans in the process and praying to God they do not retaliate.

Five contacts heading towards us, no IFF."\n\nThe comment jostled the Captain out of his relaxed state; he began checking his radar and sure enough, his wingman had the right of it. His board was lit up brightly with contacts, and they were closing fast! They would be on them in 3 or so minutes, if that. His radio began to crackle with chatter as his squadron discussed what this could mean.\n\n"Can that shit." he said roughly into his mic. "It's the Americans. No idea what they think they're doing.

The waters in the region were choppy and icy, unforgiving of the international tension that could not afford the sailors the measure of maritime peace they so desired. Instead, the Japanese had clamped down in the region, and made sure that international precedent would not dare defy the Kokutai that had reigned over the Pacific region for over two decades.\n\nHowever, intelligence had been made aware of a suddenly missing record on the list of active units of submarines in the Pacific Northeast. The note quickly shuffled through the hierarchies of ranking until it met the offices of directors; they had been made aware of the missing submarine, and considering it's last known location in close proximity to Alaskan maritime borders, the facilities were put into high alert.

Dodgson was brief with them - the ship was not only following the Basilone, but in American waters.\n\nThe officers looked at him in silent terror, as the possibilities of what this submarine was up to ran through every man's head.

His moments spent musing about the location of the disappearance, the affiliations of the crew members, and the feeble nature of the captain did not consider for once that it could be a mutiny. He clenched his jaw and pinched the bridge of his nose as he was hunched over his desk; Naval Command had no choice to confront the fact that a mutiny had likely occurred, and that the crew men were sailing to find refuge as exiles in the United States.\n\nMr. Fumio threw himself back in his chair before leaping out of his office, speeding down the corridors of Naval Command with flying papers marking his trail to inform his superiors of a probable defection. Already pressed for time and resources, a similar realization smothered their faces in a flustered stress as they were enlightened with the threatening news.

He was a determined man, the son of an IJN veteran who had served in the Pacific during the Great East Asia War; he had grown up listening to the myths of naval skirmishes in the chilling oceans and tales of conflict with the steel American fleets that sit dormant in the East. Now, he sat in the control room in a vessel of his own, faced with a similar threat in the same oceans he was fascinated with as a child.\n\nAs he was sat on his throne overseeing the commanding deck, his musing was interrupted by a transmission from Japanese Naval Command. They had been made aware of American diplomatic objections to such heavy Japanese naval presence in the region, and the tension in already disputed territorial waters have provoked Washington to accuse Tokyo of instigating a skirmish. As the information was relayed to Nagai on the crackling transmitter, the chatter of his crew slowly damped until they too were sat in silence and in awe of the mighty potential Captain Nagai now wielded.\n\nNagai glanced back at his awe-struck crew, who now looked to him intensely for guidance. The transmitter's broadcast was still live, and only the crackle of weak radio connection could be heard on the deck. Captain Nagai, now sweating, understood there was a choice to be made; he could pursue the rogue submarine like he was ordered to and risk the lives of not only his men, but countless others in the fallout to come, or he could open a communications channel with the American ships to negotiate an end to the standoff.

He described the scene to his communications officer, who in turn relayed the details in chunks back to Naval Command. The information crackled through machines, overwhelming directors with the sensationalized terror of Captain Nagai's transmissions. They found themselves confronted with a security risk of the utmost importance, and insisted that the I-3 was to pursue the rogue vessel and interrupt any channel of communications it may have with the Americans.\n\nNagai closed the broadcast channel and leaned back in his chair, pensive of his situation when looking over his frightened crew. They were diligent in their services to their captain and the empire, but the fearful look on their faces had burned through the tough exteriors they attempted to maintain.

No one could tell if the requests were to be accepted, and with the vessels in both navies dancing around disputed territories, Captain Nagai of all people knew that one wrong move could compromise his mission and risk a skirmish with Washington's mighty ships.\n\nThe silence grew more intense as the crewmen could hear depth charges rip through the ocean's waters. The powerful and shafting drive of the explosives shuddered the hull as the metal groaned, but the depth charges stuck to their course. An even more painful silence had filled the deck, suffocating the crewmen with anxious fear until a great thud could be heard on the sonar systems; the Americans had sunk the rogue submarine that the crew of the I-3 were ordered to stop.\n\nThe crewmen let out a deep sigh, and some began to chuckle in relief knowing the Americans had cooperated in the sinking of the treasonous vessel. Washington could champion that they sank a Japanese submarine, many thought, but Naval Command was grateful they did not discover the technologies and intelligence hidden within it. As his men were celebrating, Captain Nagai leaned back in his chair and hunched over.

Nodding to his armaments crew, he ordered for the priming of the weapons systems with a hungry grin, but as he turned back to face the deck his smile dropped. Many of the faces hard at work coordinating systems of the I-3 had stopped in their tracks to gaze in fear of their captain who had been seized by an irrational passion they had not seen before.\n\nFeeling the jolt of vertigo, the awe of his crew struck the captain; he gulped and exhaled slowly, attempting to drive away the nagging burden of responsibility that came with human empathy. They were genuine, real people, and all deserving of good futures; he could not bring himself to risk their lives in a confrontation so objectifying of human experiences. A battle between morality and duty warred within his skull, and with each crashing second his submarine zipped across the ocean, the closer he potentially brought his men to their doom.\n\nA sailor working on reconnaissance interrupted Captain Nagai's stream of thoughts, bellowing that the rogue vessel was within range of the I-3, and that the armaments crew would be able to fire upon Nagai's orders.

As Japanese ships bobbed about the deep waters surrounding the surfaced submarine, Marines escorted and evacuated the sweaty and exhausted crewmen on to smaller rafts to board them upon larger ships so that they may set sail for trial in Tokyo.\n\nTheir faces were wretched and bitter, defeated by their failed attempt to cross the Pacific and find refuge in what the Naval Command presumed to be Anchorage, Alaska. They had been held on the destroyer-class Minamikaze, standing on the deck in dripping sweat with their hands zip-tied behind their backs. Military photographers shot pictures of their scowls, and officers smirked at what they considered a pathetic attempt at treason; the crewmen were powerless to resist their own subjugation.\n\nCaptain Nagai towered above the battered crewmen, who reeked of perspiration and motor-oil, and felt sickened by their malevolence. They looked back up at him, slowly, and returned a scowl at his scorning presence. He let out a deep breath, looking up and out towards the chopping seas in the open air, before returning his disgusted gaze to the crewmen; he signaled with his hand and one of the marines slapped them across the face.

Silent gasps escaped the lungs of Captain Nagai's officers, and dry gulps lined the room with a tense and shuddering fear for each passing second.\n\nIn the brittle silence, an electronic siren signaled; Captain Nagai darted his head towards the wailing horn and to the shuddering crewman manning a radar. Depth charges were suddenly picked up on the radar system travelling at a high velocity in the water. They cut through the freezing oceans and rushed at full speed towards Nagai's submarine, carrying with them a terrorizing intent to pierce the hull of the vessel.

He sipped his steaming mug of coffee. His crew would be pulling up the nets; all he had to do was keep watch, make sure that they didn't run into any ghost ships.\n\n"Hey, Cap? The nets are all pulled up. We're ready to go." A crewman poked his head into the bridge, telling Norbert that they were ready to set off. Norbert shook his head.\n\n"Not when visibility is like this. We'll wait a few hours, see if things clear up."\n\n"There's nobody else around here, Captain. We're the only American boat for miles, and come on, what are the chances that the Japanese are going to poke around so far from home -"\n\nNorbert shushed the crewman, then peered through his binoculars. A dark shadow, rising out of the fog, morphed into the shape of a fishing trawler. Through his binoculars, he could make out a Japanese flag, and a man in the opposing bridge staring back at him."

His crew had all finished pulling up the nets, and were now manning their stations elsewhere, bringing the engines back up to speed and preparing to get underway.\n\nHe looked at the navigational charts - worn, but still current. He checked his plotted course, the product of an unchanging routine observed meticulously each day, and he was convinced.\n\n"We are in Japanese waters. The Americans should not be here," he announced to his crew. The younger men laughed at the arrogance - and stupidity - of the Americans.\n\n"We must tell them to leave our waters, immediately," one ventured.\n\n"You know English?" another asked.\n\nSuddenly, the bridge fell silent. Captain Yamada considered his remaining options."

He'd have to file a Coast Guard report; he'd done everything right, hadn't he? They sometimes were awfully particular about maritime safety.\n\nAll something to think about tomorrow. For now, he had to check the catch."

It turned - towards the Alaskan Catch. The engine roared, and the Japanese ship began to pick up speed, without changing course.\n\n"Get the engines going!" Norbert screamed at his crew. The Alaskan Catch's engines hummed, and the ship began to glide forward in the water - too slow to dodge the Japanese ship, if it stayed on course.\n\nThe Japanese ship drew closer, and closer, until at the last moment it swerved, avoiding a head-on collision, but with the entire length of the ship slamming against the Alaskan Catch. Norbert and his crew were thrown to the deck as the Alaskan Catch reeled.\n\n"Captain! What are your orders?""

After sending a crewman to check on the engines, Captain Yamada went out on the deck, looking for the American vessel.\n\nIt was drawing away, gaining speed, while listing slightly from the collision.

"Our contacts in Alaska have noted that local papers have carried news of a local fishing ship ramming the Aoba Maru, before turning over its crew to the local coast guard for questioning."\n\nThat made more sense, the Director-General reasoned. Attu was the back end of nowhere; he was surprised a boat had decided to go there, but it was in their right to do so - and the Americans had decided to trample on it.\n\n"How many are in custody?"\n\n"Twelve, sir. Out of a crew of twenty."\n\nThat raised the stakes considerably. If the Foreign Minister and the wider Cabinet - or worse, the military - got involved, who knew how badly this could escalate?

They brought the survivors back to the Coast Guard." His subordinate replied sheepishly.\n\n"Shit." Even if the Japanese were in American waters, having an American boat ram a Japanese one - and sink it - was going to cause some problems. "I'm guessing the Japanese government's got something to say?"\n\n"They want our help looking for any survivors that might have been missed."\n\nThe veteran diplomat sighed in relief. "That's it?

The Secretary grabbed the receiver on the first ring.\n\n"The Foreign Minister just called," the Ambassador relayed. "There will be no intervention by the Japanese military."\n\nThe Secretary of State felt a huge weight being lifted from his shoulders. "Thank god, they're being reasonable."\n\n"That wasn't all, Mr. Secretary." The weight moved from the Secretary's shoulders to his stomach.

The Japanese military was on high alert and considering aggressive action in response to... the sinking of one of their fishing ships off of Alaska? It sounded ridiculous, but the Secretary had been deadly serious.\n\n"High level diplomatic negotiations are ongoing, and we're awaiting a response from Tokyo. In the meantime, maintain maximum readiness. We don't want a repeat of Pearl Harbor."\n\nOn that, everybody agreed, and so the General had ordered all American air defense assets on high alert.

The phone rang, and an aide handed the receiver to the Foreign Minister. A nod, a grunt of affirmation. The Minister turned to the Cabinet.\n\n"The Americans will abandon their plans for a trial. We'll have the crew back in a week."\n\nA chorus of relieved sighs - or self-satisfied grins, on the part of the Army and Navy ministers - echoed through the room.

While the bond between the two superpowers had gotten colder since the inebriating years of victory over the Second World War, there still remained a fledgling essence of brotherhood among giants, as both held the familiar path of thrusting their once weakened and humiliated nations straight into the laurels of august hegemony over their respective spheres - masters of their own fate, bound by none of the now-defeated old.\n\nOf course, there was a more down-to-earth reason as to why Japan's leadership rarely entertained any future involving confrontation with the German Reich, and that would be logistics. Many of the maps, battlefield reports and other forms of data concerning the formations of the Wehrmacht's divisions and assessment of their strength date all the way back to 1945, making them utterly outdated and useless to be offering any tactical benefit for the Imperial Army. With the grim bonus of the Germans excelling in covering up their more dangerous toys in their arsenal, any current response to their aggravating actions could only result in bloodshed on a crippling scale for Japan; a massacre to which the Prime Minister would prefer to slate as a last resort.\n\nThe Prime Minister acknowledges these issues, and he is quick to reiterate to his subordinates that something must be done to counteract the technological advantage of their Aryan foes. Sacrifices will no doubt be made to pay for the blood price of securing the future of the Emperor's subjects - and if there is one thing that the Japanese understood better than their old brother-in-arms..."

Years ago, the late Adolf Hitler had granted to the Japanese the prestigious title of "Honorary Aryans", for he saw in them that despite their differences in culture, doctrines and especially genetics, they were not so different in their desire to manifest a destiny stolen from them by the perfidious Allies. After all, they too suffered the blindness of the imperialist parasites that sought to promulgate the corruption of their Judeo-Bolshevik puppet masters upon the innocent people they relished in their oppression. But now, the times have changed; whatever wisdom or intellect Hitler had seen in the Rising Sun perished in his departure to Valhalla, and with it, the new Führer's respect for the mongrels of the East.\n\nIn a public declaration before the Volkshalle, the Führer declared that the Japanese are now revoked of their status as Honorary Aryans, their failure to comprehending reason and the pleas for diplomatic resolution a telltale sign to the Reich that the Japanese have grown barbaric, their minds now cursed with the infection of the Untermensch's way of thought. With fire in his vocals and thunder in his clenched fists, the Führer laments this horrific betrayal by those they once called their brethren, their friendship spat on and their alliance of steel withered and rusted by the decadence that infests the Emperor's domain.\n\nAt the announcement's closing before the roaring crowd energized by anger and zeal, the Führer promises to his people that Germany shall respond to this insolence with fire and fury, that the only consequence deserving of a traitor to the Reich's generosity is by being swept aside as burning embers to their folly. A flurry of arms raise high in salute to this howl for war towards the great, golden eagle that hangs high above the stage."

After much debate, the Prime Minister and his cabinet have agreed that the oncoming war won't be fought by rifles and tanks, but by battleship cannons and screaming aircraft; no doubt was shown to the veritable notion that Germany wouldn't hesitate to make use of its nuclear weapons upon Japan, making much of the IJA's ground forces obsolete at the first rain of nuclear hellfire begins to crack through the grim skies.\n\nThey had confidence in the capabilities of the Emperor's warriors in the Navy and the Air Force, if not in the flimsy hope that the conflict wouldn't escalate to utter atomic annihilation by both sides. The Prime Minister could not help but to entertain the possibility of a traditional war himself, as would a few others among his cabinet, but atomic fire or not, there still would be hundreds of thousands of souls that would be sacrifice to the meat grinder that was to come - the only difference was whether their deaths would be abruptly swift or gruesomely slow.\n\nEven as it appeared that the Rising Sun was to set upon its glorious empire, its people would not abandon their trademark resolve to see their fate through till the end. The Prime Minister, his cabinet, his generals: they all were aware of the stakes, The Nazis may resort to their titan-killer weapons to uphold their fantasies of being masters above all, but Japan had endured the wrath of greater giants time and time again. First, the Bear; then, the Bald Eagle and now?"

The same could be said as to how another World War could begin during the Age of Atom, a war in which the partaking nations will rely not on the steel of their weapons or the bravery of their men, but by a weapon so nefarious and destructive that even the old gods could feel its tremor from their realm.\n\nYet despite this nuclear sword of Damocles hanging above the two stirring giants, the Führer had nonetheless sent orders to the Oberkommando das Heeres to initiate secret battle plans drawn up years since after the Weltkrieg; contingencies that mandated the use of the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine to dominate the seas and airspace of the Japanese Home Islands to make way for a land invasion of great magnitude that hasn't been seen since Unternehmen Seelöwe. Any hope of a peaceful resolution was dashed by the roaring screeches of Messerschmitt fighters and the droning horns of the Kriegsmarine's terrifying warships, the full might of the German Reich's warmachine now making haste to sail for the lands of the Rising Sun like a coming storm of iron and vengeance.\n\nIt is only fitting that the phases behind this ambitious invasion match the varying steps that summon forth the carnage of Ragnarok: Skoll and Hati, the wolves who chase the Sun and Moon, marks the arrival of the Fatherland's vanguard of ships and aircraft, and for the great battalion of soldiers that would take the battle against the Japanese upon their own soil, fighting these traitors to the Reich's superiority straight to the streets of Tokyo...\n\nThey were dubbed "Armeegruppe Fenris" and "Armeegruppe Jormungandr"."

Across the Home Islands and the greater Sphere, the Prime Minister's voice beamed through every radio and his face shone on every screen, promising to the people that the divine mandate of the Japanese people shall not be crushed by the arrogant Reich and its pride-drunken barbarians. While there can be only so much one man can do to rally a whole empire through the creeping veil of fright and doubt, an ecstatic energy shines among those who feel brave, ready to take up arms against the Nazis in what could be their greatest battle yet since the last war.\n\nIn Germany, the same essence of fear and doubt plagues the citizens of the Aryan Reich, their vigor for battle spurred by the fiery oration of their Führer as he, just like his counterpart from the East, promises that destiny sides with the superior race, that the Third Reich shall yet again prove its mastery over all by crushing the Empire of the Rising Sun and reminding the world of the indomitable might of Hitler's glorious civilization. Citizens already line the streets from the many recruitment offices dotting the cities, each staffed by men and women promising fame and glory to the courageous men willing to lay down their lives for the Fatherland.\n\nThe two titans were now awoken, their great vessels of steel and their vast swarms of unquestionably loyal warriors crossing through ocean and hearth to prepare for the greatest clash between superpowers seen since the days of the Weltkrieg. In a few hours, the Kriegsmarine and the Imperial Navy shall clash off the coast of Hokkaido, the thunder of their guns heralding their finale just as the hammer of Thor crashed down upon the beasts set loose upon the realm of Asgard."

Walking into the situation room in Langley was almost automatic for Richard, and he noticed something wrong with every step he took, each faster than the last. The smell of stale coffee was almost entirely absent from the offices, with the only remnants of it being in the smell which stained the rooms around him. Speaking of which, the office was empty. The calendars didn't even have today marked off, it was like everyone took the day off. He was running now, the situation room had gotten closer, and with it a deafening silence, even for the offices. It was like a black hole of sound had opened up, keeping things in an unearthly silence, until a voice stopped Richard in his tracks.\n\n"It isn't! It's bullshit!" The doors swung open, and Daryl marched outside, avoiding eye contact with much of anything, his white collared shirt soaking through with sweat, and his thick-rimmed eyeglasses seeming as though they would fly off through his spite alone. Pushing the door open, the scene struck Richard into a state of disbelief. Half of everyone in the office was sitting there in absolute silence, few eyes flicking over to him as he stood in the doorway, the light of the hallway illuminating the dust floating through the air, and the cigarette smoke that flooded into Richard's sinuses.\n\nEmily, Danny, and John all sat together in a triangle of chairs, smoking cigarettes, bags under their eyes. Even in the near pitch black, Richard could tell from the luminescence of the light alone that they were deathly tired. Michael and Tam were whispering to each other, barely audible at all, probably talking about the good times they had with each other. Everyone knew about the two, but nobody could show any legitimate care for the pair, not right now. The scene was illuminated by a deep orange light, bolted onto the wall, and the sign read simply:"

While its wings had been broken by the might of the Samurai, the Eagle had been defeated but not fully brought to heel. Through indirect means of sabotaging Tokyo's hegemony, whether by their secret services or by their economic manipulations, the United States have yet to surrender their foolish belief that they will retake what has been lost in the war, that their might shall return and that the Japanese will pay for their "tyranny" with blood.\n\nEvidently, it is all but mere sabre-rattling by the Yankees, who simply cannot understand the notion of honorably accepting their defeat and accepting their weakness. However, they have recently begun to grow increasingly erratic in their interference of our activities, to such an extent that their military assets have begun to ramp up their momentum to dangerously active performance levels. Whether the Americans are trying to intimidate through a show of force or going forward with a build-up of forces, it remains to be seen.\n\nWhatever the case may be, Japan will be ready. Like the great warriors of old, clad in their armor and wielding their katanas with merciless efficiency, it shall await the dangers to come."

Alan had already made his call to command; they were well aware of the situation, though sitting in the stuffy command center of a submarine a dozen leagues beneath the ocean surface did little to ease his nerves. If anything, they worsened because of it. He could tell the mood was no different for those around him, too. The air had stiffened, even for a submarine. Looking around at those around him, Alan could tell from the pale visages and shuddering hands that everyone had the same thoughts running through their heads, like a broken record on a loop that couldn't be stopped. Their headsets chattered with the voices of radar specialists and the high command in the OFN. Alan's radar was already being transmitted to high command, and it was a weird feeling knowing that the big shots in Washington were watching over his charts, same as he was supposed to. Not that he could focus on them in the least with what he'd need to be focused on.\n\nIt was like a digital fourth of July. As the radar's pulse washed over the screen time and time again, and the pings illuminated the screen to the point that it looked like Alan was looking at a dozen fireflies dancing above the Louisianan swamp he knew so well, the horrific implications of the Japanese on the move were enough to make him snap out of his daze.\n\nHe could overhear the conversations of others beginning to disturb his thoughts. The tone of voice used by those around him was hushed and stern, like they were talking to a misbehaving child in the company of others. Tuning into the conversations over his headset, Alan couldn't help but feel his stomach drop, not due to any bad News circulating, but for lack of good News. All there was in the steel, sealed can beneath the ocean was a mundane collection of mutters speaking of Japanese warships. Alan laid back in his chair."

Such a saying can never be more exemplified than among the members of the Empire's high command, officers and leaders of glorious pride and grim determination that, for all the years in service of their nation, of their Emperor, this would be the first time that astonishment - and confusion - would grace their steely spirits, as the nerve center of Japan's military thrummed in an utter chaotic frenzy.\n\nThe truth that struck these men was one they thought impossible, after everything they had done to ensure the Eagle remained grounded and stripped of its talons: the Americans, after all their talk of "settling the score", have begun to act. Even now, as operators attempt to relay and confirm hectic reports from the Empire's surveillance bases, there are multiple confirmed sightings of USAF aircraft en-route for China, South East Asia and, most horrible of all, Japan itself.\n\nSome men knew this was a far graver issue than the Hawaii Crisis, years ago; others have already shown weakness through cowardly begging that what they hear, what they see is all but a mistake, a grave issue caused by their technology. A few Generals have also succumbed to this gnawing parasite of fear plaguing what resolve they held to maintain their tactical sharpness, while the rest showed little to no sign whether this matter concerned them or worse. However they were affected, they were to face an unchanging reality, one in which its resolution was to be made with immediate haste.\n\nThey needed to act now, for the fate of the Empire now hangs by a slim thread."

Frank was more concerned with not bumping into generals and getting to meet the President. Frank certainly hadn't voted for 'em, but hey, rubbing elbows with the powerful is always a great opportunity. Normally, the NMCC was a strictly "eyes only" sort of operation, but the brass didn't seem too worried about procedure today. Frank didn't mind. He loved getting the chance to see the sausage get made.\n\nFrank Jones, in his enviable and optimistic ignorance, was getting on the President's nerves. Who was this kid running back and forth with a smile on his face? Didn't he know what DEFCON 2 means? Does he even care? The Secretary of State spending gut-wrenching hours attempting to force open the Japanese diplomatic channels with no success; wannabe generalissimos with itchy trigger fingers on both sides. This could be the big one, and all this Frank Jones kid is doing about it is putting creamer in coffee? Not even a call to his sweetheart? Would he even notice the bombs going off?\n\nFrank saw the President staring straight at him, and gave a big smile and thumbs up in return. Always good to have friends at the top, but he didn't expect the President to get so chummy so fast! A great day to be Frank Jones, as always. Frank dutifully carried files to and fro, enjoying his time as the intern-in-chief, and as the day grew into night, he delivered to the President orange chicken from Frank's personal favorite Chinese place. He expected a warm thank you, or at least to get his money back. Instead, the President seemed distracted by something, so Frank took the chicken for himself.\n\nThe President was indeed distracted, to say the least. The Secretary of State finally opened channels with the Japanese, but they were only saying one thing. A blanket refusal to any and all negotiations. No peace talks, no backchannel discussions, no hotline. The IJN was steaming towards the USA, and the Americans had better get ready for the third World War. The President would have to go before the nation, not as an elected leader, but as a herald of death. They just hoped they could make America's Frank Joneses listen."

Quite unexpectedly but nonetheless welcome by the Prime Minister and his cabinet, the Army and the Navy have come to cast aside their petty rivalry for the purpose of defending their homeland against these barbarians who have yet to learn their place, each side providing a contingency that will make the United States pay dearly for this act of aggression.\n\nHowever, as the discussions for a response have yet to spawn favorable results, an aide comes rushing into the chambers to the Prime Minister's side, informing him that the American President has issued an ultimatum: a cease to all hostilities - a cease to Japan's mandate as the dominant force in the Pacific.\n\nAll eyes were now on the Prime Minister, each waiting with varying levels of intensity as they awaited the final answer to this blasphemous demand by the Americans. To refuse this demand was to banish the Empire to extinction by nuclear fire, in exchange of safeguarding their honor; to accept it was not even worth consideration to some, for it meant that Japan would show weakness before the enemy, weakness to the people it leads beneath its crimson glare. The only audible sound within that chamber was the ticking of the clocks, each second shaping what would be the Prime Minister's final decision."

All stared at the glowing image of President [GetPresidentLastName], propped up behind the Resolute desk.\n\n"This is not a decision I take lightly," said the President, glancing for a moment away from the camera to a photo on [GetHerHis] desk as if it could provide any escape. "I, like all of you, remember the costs of the Second World War, of the horrors inflicted by the Japanese on our soldiers and the people of Hawaii. We cannot hesitate in opposing offensive threats on the part of any nation, whether they be small or large."\n\nOn the opposite side of the world in the small city of Nikkō, a similar scene played out.
