 POLITICS_Wilhelm_Mohnke_DESC:0 "Stand tall. Stand strong. Stand tall. Stand strong. Anything else is weak, and standing down is never an option. Weakness is never an option.\n\nDedication, persistence, and, in the words of some, stubbornness defines the backbone of the character that is SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer Wilhelm Mohnke. Born into a blue-collar household, Mohnke rooted himself within the NSDAP and the Schutzstaffel at the young age of twenty-two, where his military career would bring him into a constant state of dipping and dodging through multiple international accusations of massacres of prisoners-of-war. These slaughterous exploits would see one of the culminations of Mohnke's career, in which a severe air raid over Yugoslavia bombarded Mohnke, leading doctors to ignore the officer's demands that he be released as soon as possible, and choosing to amputate his leg instead. Already a dedicated man, Mohnke's refusal to budge and stubbornness in work engulfed his being in rage towards his new handicapped situation. However, his newfound situation would find himself deep in Berlin, and reveling in the successes of the Reich in the newly crowned Germania, as he led the Hitler Youth and beyond to cheers for the German people.\n\nHowever, after the war, it was the Reichsführer-SS who truly donned the mantle of control over the general. Seeing Mohnke's presence amongst the youth and unyieldingness as a direct asset, he became a notable participant in standing his grounds with the Reichsführer-SS during the attempted coups of the 50's, and it was the Reichsführer-SS's influence that found Mohnke a life within the Ordensstaat, becoming crowned as the commander of the SS-Leibstandarte Heinrich Himmler, utilizing his scrutinizing mannerisms, thorough investigations, and forever-reaching unwillingness to yield...\n\nHowever, the time has come, in the eyes of the Reichsführer-SS, to utilize the SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer... with the care of his life. As Heydrich and Mohnke's master tear away at each other, Germans continue to flee to the West to try to find a means of escape from the chaos, maybe into the Iberias or whatnot. Mohnke, however, will serve as the barrier, the border guard, and the wall against these refugees. After all, as far as Mohnke is concerned, an assassin could be well-hidden as that old man with a cane, or that woman with three children..."

They have turned the Rhine's Western back into an unbroken network of fortifications, something they had clearly been preparing for years, to face them unprepared is to ask for death."
