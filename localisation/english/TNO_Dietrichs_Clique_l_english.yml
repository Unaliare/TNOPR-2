 POLITICS_SEPP_DIETRICH_DESC:0 "This wasn't right. None of this was just, none of it. Serving a titan, serving the Master of Europe, and now all that had been forged was left in tatters. This wasn't right!\n\nJosef "Sepp" Dietrich was born within Bavaria, due west from the grand birthplace of the Victor of the Second World War himself, right on time to serve the German people in the Great War. Yet, the embers of a fire once-scorching hadn't burnt out yet, and through the blood of the traitors in the Night of the Long Knives spilt by Dietrich's hands themselves, Germany found itself rising, with Adolf Hitler as its crowning star. Yet, by that star's shine was none other than the SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer Dietrich himself, having found himself clawed and torn his way through the Nazi Party and the Schutzstaffel to serving as the commander of the Führer's personal bodyguard.\n\nMassacre after massacre, bloodbath after bloodbath, all had been done in the name of the Führer, and as the war came to the light of victory, Dietrich found himself donning a fire in his eye, ready to watch as the world knelt to the Thousand Year Reich. However, when things began to fall, so greatly did they plunder the heart of the mighty Praetorian, as he witnessed his beloved Reich collapse. Now, so truly has the folly of man's pride divided the Aryan people, as Germany continues to bleed.\n\nBut Dietrich doesn't believe he deserves this. No. He knows he doesn't deserve this. He guarded Hitler himself, and now Heydrich and Himmler will have to bend to his clique to ensure his loyalty."

 DSH_directed_anarchy:0 "Directed Anarchy"
 DSH_directed_anarchy_desc:0 "Upon arriving in his native Bavaria, Sepp Dietrich declared himself 'Duke of Bavaria' and that any who were loyal to him would make themselves known with a black arm band; those that did not would be considered 'partisans' before retiring to Neuschwanstein Castle. This left his commanders to do as they wished with the populace, throwing the region into a form of 'controlled anarchy'."
 
 DSH_volkswache:0 "The Volkswache"
 DSH_volkswache_desc:0 "With the decree came a loophole, many rapists, murderers, and thieves in prison now called out their loyalty to Dietrich and asked him to pardon them. In a show of magnanimity, Dietrich had 100 of them executed and the rest were inducted into the newly formed "Volkswache" or People's Guard. These black armbanded thugs now patrol the streets alongside the SS, subjecting the populace to their every whim and desires, in The Name of The Duke."
