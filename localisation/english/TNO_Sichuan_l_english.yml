 SIC_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "In the war against Japan few bleed and died as Sichuan did. Countless young men were drafted in China's defense, and the province rallied to Chiang-Kai-Shek and the republican banner. It was all for naught. By 1947 the Imperial Japanese Army had crushed their province, devastating both the land and the people. Finally, in 1949 it ceased to be under military administration and was handed over to Tian Songyao. Over the past decade the ruined province has slowly been rebuilt, and its devastated population has gradually recovered. Now Tian Songyao can finally begin the development and improvement of his native land and paint over the scars of war. But this time, it will be a Sichuan for the Sichuanese. He will not easily see his people slaughtered by Nanjing's command again."

 #POLITICS_TIAN_SONGYAO_DESC:0 "It's not only clear to his immediate subordinates that Tian Songyao is a thoroughly indifferent man. Fears have sprouted concerning his potential death due to the fact that the tired warlord has not made a public appearance in weeks. However, Tian Songyao is alive and well, as his favorite concubine and his accountant know all too well. Every few months, an inordinate amount of money leaves the bank, and nobody says a word, for they assume the next banker knows something of it. And every few months, Tian's accountant takes in a few more bundles of cash.\n\nHowever, few blink much of an eye. Back east, in Nanjing, a few bureaucrats have raised a stink, but they have no authority in Chongqing. Very little information about positive developments aside from a few economic reports come out of sleepy Sichuan, but Tian is not so indifferent for no reason. After failing to stop the Communist Party of China in their Long March north, Tian fell out of favor with Chiang Kai-Shek and was left in minor commanding positions. Growing tired of losing battles during the war, Tian betrayed the KMT to Reorganized Chinese forces by fomenting a revolt within the Sichuan Clique.\n\nWhile he failed to secure the west and dislodge Wenhui, he succeeded in taking the populous and industrious east. In the end, it turned out this all went well, but the spoils of victory are entirely uninteresting to the man who has gained the moniker of "Winter Melon"."
