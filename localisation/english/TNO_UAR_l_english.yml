UAR_disunited_armies_desc: "While our soldiers are willing to fight, they are more like a disjointed mob than a proper fighting force. As our nation is at its infancy, its army is still developing, and it will take time before we are able to established a united army."

While our attempts to wrangle and integrate the various political entities within the state shall prove to be challenging initially, our efforts will pay off in the long run."
