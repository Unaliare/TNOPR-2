 #Leader description
 POLITICS_TAIMUR_DESC:0 "In a increasingly unstable region, the Sultunate of Oman lays at the center of a growing tide of chaos, sandwiched between danger on every side. To the north and east is the Italian empire: fragile, but with a ever-growing thirst for oil, and plenty of guns, influence, and diplomacy to spare to take it. To the west is Saudi arabia, its fanatic Wahhabi leaders only barely held back from further conquest by fears of the predations of the colonial powers. To the east is the ocean, where the grasping claws of tigers, eagles and dragons alike grow ever closer. From within the nation's desert hinterlands Arab nationalists and rebellious Imam's wax in strength, their numbers matched only by their dedication. Surely, when such threats abound, the Sultanate can rely on strong and dedicated leadership?\n\nAlas, for the scion responsible for confronting these dangers is Said bin Taimur, a man barely able to rule his family and palace, let alone the nation beyond. Forced to choose between Italian protection and the dangers of isolation, he went with a feeble middle course, signing a humiliating "treaty of friendship" but refusing to join the Triumvirate or accept their advisors. Rather than using Oman's oil wealth to improve the lot of the nation's miserable populace, Taimur chooses to buy liquor and fast cars, and maintain the loyalty of his people by prohibiting them from using such moral dangers as cassette players and film reels.\n\nAs its nominal sultan retreats ever further into paranoia and isolation, alternating between drunken stupors and screaming fits, the rule alternates between scheming councillors and his son Qaboos, himself hypothetically under house arrest. It has become increasingly clear to international observers that Oman's survival in this dangerous new age is owed only to chance and the preoccupation of its rivals. How much longer this approach is feasible is deeply questionable."

 OMA_the_old_sultan:0 "The Old Sultan"
 OMA_the_old_sultan_desc:0 "Sultan Said bin Taimur is certainly a great man, how could he be otherwise? So confident in his rule is the Sultan, that he does not even need to leave his palace, instead indulging in the well earned luxury of the truly powerful. There are some that whisper that surely the nation's relatively modest oil reserves could not support extravagance of this magnitude, and that the money must come from darker sources, but they are deluded fools. Beyond a doubt, the dynasty that has led Oman for two hundred years will lead it for a thousand to come."
 
 OMA_the_young_heir:0 "The Young Heir"
 OMA_the_young_heir_desc:0 "It is one of the endless tragedies of declining empires that weak rulers usually beget weak sons. It is strange then that unlike his father, Qaboos proved himself from an early age to be intelligent, diligent, and hungry for the rights and responsibilities of rulership. Now however, both men refrain from public life except for the occasional speech from a balcony. Those below are left to wonder whether their relationship is one of father and son, ruler and subject, or jailer and prisoner."

 OMA_whispers_in_the_desert_desc:0 "For a thousand years the Middle East has been the domain of Sultans and Sheikhs. Now however, new forces with new ideas can be found in every alley and patch of sand. Shadows lurk in the Yemeni desert, tribesman go out to hunt and don't return. Youths put down farming tools to pick up rifles and balaclavas, telling stories of socialist liberation, or of a Islamic renaissance. By the pronouncement of his majesty Sultan Said bin Taimur, such rumors are nothing but nonsense, and those who tell them nothing but traitors in need of chastisement."
