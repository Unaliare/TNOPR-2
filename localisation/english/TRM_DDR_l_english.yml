DDR_risen_from_the_ruins: "Risen from Ruins"
DDR_risen_from_the_ruins_desc: "The German people have suffered enough. Mothers mourn their sons who went to die in pointless imperialist ventures and brothers fought against brothers during the Bürgerkrieg. Now, we are faced with the task of overcoming old scars, triumphing over bygone sorrow, and revitalizing our nation to build a path for peace and unity. The revolutionary struggle has been won and the sleeping giant of socialism will be awakened again.\n\nThe foundations for infrastructure, technology, and industry had been laid by the previous regimes, even if it was damaged due to their own mistakes or in the necessary battles to dismantle those same regimes. Our socialist society will not only recover what was lost but improve the conditions to a degree that has never been seen before. And so, as Marx foretold, our transitional stage begins."
DDR_the_chairman_speaks: "The Chairman Speaks"
DDR_the_chairman_speaks_desc: "Wolf's journey of resistance was always one of secrecy and even as his small group grew to lead an army, only a select few knew his voice, his face, or even his name. His comrades only called him Mischa or Der Rote, as revealing his identity would lead to ensured tragedy. Now, Markus Wolf stands as the undisputed chairman of the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands and oversees a nation of over one hundred million people, turning his life and appearance more public than he could ever imagine.\n\nIt is time for the head of the party to address the entire nation, with words of hope and unity, a paramount declaration to the entire workers of the world and the opressed nations that yearn for freedom, that the epoch of proletarian revolution will continue and that the German people will pursue the path of liberation that Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin conceptualized. "


DDR_uniting_the_sed: "Uniting the SED"
DDR_uniting_the_sed_desc: "It is clear as day that socialism will be the future of Germany, yet, our party remains split on how to truly construct it. The 'sects' of communists who fought against national socialism under various cells eventually formed their own army and what has become the party organization, which itself became the vanguard of the working class of Germany and definitely the strongest of its kind.\n\nAs we struggle to build a second home of the revolution, to secure it from rotting away and falling apart, we must protect it from bourgeois ideas, such as revisionism, reformism, and nationalism. We must truly build a Marxist-Leninist party in Germany, as Comrade Ernst Thälmann and Wilhelm Pieck foresaw in their writings, one that will guide the proletariat every step of the way and eviscerate fascism and capitalism from our planet."

DDR_finishing_them_off: "Finishing Them Off"
DDR_finishing_them_off_desc: "Stains like the one we’ve washed from our Fatherland are seldom easy to remove, as has been proven throughout these past weeks. Even now, bombings continue to plague our most vital industrial hearts, whilst the countryside burns with the smoke and hatred of a thousand rebels that seek nothing less than to tear down all that we’ve built. The truth is apparent, as painful as it is to realize: National Socialism still lives, be it in the hearts of men or through the barrel of a rifle.\n\nRegardless, Comrade Wolf has made clear his “zero tolerance” policy towards the remnants, and so they will be dealt with accordingly. These savage reactionaries are simply denying the inevitable! Even now, our soldiers ready themselves to quash any remaining resistance, whilst our police build networks of strength and loyalty, alongside our Volkspolizei allies, across our most vulnerable cities and councils. As we have fought just mere months before, we shall fight once again. All for the sake of the beautiful revolution."

DDR_begin_the_long_reconstruction: "Begin the Long Reconstruction"
DDR_begin_the_long_reconstruction_desc: "Swathes of the Rhine’s industrial heart remain in tatters. Hundreds of acres of farmland continue to burn, its soil tainted by bomb and toxin combined. Cities, though having already begun reconstruction, still remain husks of their former selves. The destruction of our Fatherland cannot be understated, nor can the effort that lies ahead. Thus, for such an incredible war, there must also be an incredible effort to rebuild.\n\nAlready, the Central Committee has already convened to approve the formation of a national authority to handle local and large-scale reconstruction alike: the Volks Wiederaufbau Behörde, the People’s Reconstruction Authority. Their coordination and financial resources, along with their allocation of workers for national projects, will be vital to raise our republic back from the depths of toil and destitution. It shall be long, yes, but the rewards we reap from it shall carry our revolution to untold success. We will not fail!"

DDR_striking_their_bases: "Striking Their Bases"
DDR_striking_their_bases_desc: "In the cities and towns of our nation, men and women of the revolution go about their lives. One can hardly imagine that these people were just months prior suffering under the boot of fascists and capitalists.\n\nBut, in the forests, in the Schwarzwald, and in the mountains, exist remnants of the old order. Fascist rats congregate in abandoned military installations, former Hitler Youth camps, and makeshift compounds. If we are to finally purge the Nazis and their influence on our nation, we must strike their bases."

DDR_smashing_the_swastika: "Smashing the Swastika"
DDR_smashing_the_swastika_desc: "From the beginning, Hitler and his animalistic followers saw it fit to implement their horrendous culture of domineering supremacy into every facet of European life. From architecture and literature, to even the way we walk on the streets, it was all molded to dance with the tune of Germania’s strings. As decades passed, it became a simple fact of life for the average German. We know better now. We all know better now.\n\nIf we hope to advance the liberation of all peoples, we must tear it all down. Comrade Wolf has asked for nothing less than a “deconstruction of the past, so that we may advance the future.” Our citizens will be called upon to take the charge, finding and destroying all that could drag down the revolution or sympathize with the past. Simultaneously, the creation of new ministries with broad powers concerning the control of anti-revolutionary materials will begin in earnest. Soon, there will be nothing holding us back from the utopia we were promised so long ago. "

DDR_expose_their_crimes: "Expose Their Crimes"
DDR_expose_their_crimes_desc: "For too long, the crimes committed by the Führer and his crooked butchers have been hidden from the public. We have paid lip service and denounced the various humanitarian disasters and mass killings carried out under the Third Reich, yet many still turn a blind eye to the endless list of other heinous and inhuman acts done by their hand. The Central Committee has decided that this situation will remain no more. The entire truth shall not be concealed.\nor weeks, we have been preparing a lengthy list of reports, documents, and first-hand accounts that go into every single detail of the horrifying brutality of the Führer's regime, and the next step will be to compile and share it, be it through the radio, the television, history classes, word of mouth, and through various writings of our most prolific authors and newspapers. If a lie was told a thousand times, let the truth be told two thousand times more."

DDR_hold_the_hamburg_trials: "Hold the Hamburg Trials"
DDR_hold_the_hamburg_trials_desc: "The German nation has a long tradition regarding the law, dating to the Imperial period, whether it be private or public. Sadly, much of our unified codification and jurisdiction was severely hurt by the 'Volksgesetzbuch', a new code in which the NSDAP could effortlessly twist the laws to suit their needs. With both penal and civil codes harmed by their hand,  the fate of building a truly fair system now rests with us. Our codes must punish crimes against the people, peace, humanity, and human rights, so that the innocent may be protected.\nInstead of some dispersed communal laws, a homogeneous legislature will be implemented that will serve not only to punish but to rehabilitate, whilst doing away with the unethical laws of the old. Be it by the noose, by work, or by the bullet, the hammer of justice will continue the work of crushing the snake of Nazism as we will put our laws to test and show the world that fascism is on its deathbed."

DDR_enact_mass_nationalization: "Enact Mass Nationalization"
DDR_enact_mass_nationalization_desc: "No matter who rules in Germany or around the world, be it a Kaiser, be it a President, be it a Führer a constant has permanently been there, the monopolist, the stock owner, and the bank executive. When Europe sends the youngest among them, is the factory owners who send the weapons, the medicine, the food, and the uniforms to the front line, taking a large profit for themself, in times of economic crisis, these are the parasites who live in luxury while the rest of society suffers unemployment and hunger.\n\nThe time has come for these rats to give what they have for so long ruled, the factories, the mines, the farms, the truck stations, and train lines that transport the products as well as the harbors that export them, all shall be place on the hands of the state and the worker, where they will stay with a firm grip control by those who work them and not those who profit from the work of others."

DDR_form_the_peoples_enterprises: "Form the Peoples Enterprises"
DDR_form_the_peoples_enterprises_desc: "The era of corporatism and capitalist domination over our economy is a relic of the past. Now, a legal form of industrial enterprise comes to the front, the Volkseigener Betrieb, an enterprise made, worked by, and ruled by the people. From, the managing director, to the secretary of the factory party organization, to the trade unionist, the chief accountant, the technical director, and the common worker, each will proudly cooperate as equals.\n\nThe Associations of Publicly Owned Enterprises will vertically integrate major industries to consolidate production and reduce waste,  as under the responsibility of the State Planning Commission, we will establish new enterprises for the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy, going from consumer goods to light industries, raw materials, light, and heavy industries, electronics and all the People's Republic will need to produce for the people and the revolution."

DDR_a_house_for_every_german: "A House for Every German"
DDR_a_house_for_every_german_desc: "One of the most devasting effects of both the Bürgerkrieg and now the Revolution was the already strained housing system shattering. Across Germany, homelessness, one of the worst scourges of Capitalism, has gripped the proletariat. If we are to secure the Volksrepublik, we must deal with this problem before it gets any worse.\n\nThankfully Max Reimann has proposed an interesting idea. An en-masse construction program to secure housing for the German people alongside a propaganda campaign to get those with housing to help those without. Konrad Wolf, the Chairman’s brother already has his name proposed for control over the propaganda side of this campaign. Housing shall be secured as a right, not as a commodity or a privilege and renovations will be in order to recover old homes."

DDR_the_plattenbau_system: "The Plattenbau System"
DDR_the_plattenbau_system_desc: "As the struggle to end homelessness and poverty continues, the method of large panel system buildings has come up as a cheaper and more efficient solution to our vast nation. To curb the housing shortage in areas affected by wartime conflicts and mismanagement from the fascist tyrants, we must construct new residential eras with these new styles along with some models of old ones and the already ongoing process of reconstruction.\n\nReimann has drawn out the main factors, the accommodation, the location, the population of the region, and the flexible designs of the prefabricated slabs of concrete that make up the homes of tomorrow are truly going to become a symbol of socialism and modernization. The smiling old man has also proposed giving color so that this robust and inexpensive system doesn't look dreadful."

DDR_the_anti_fascist_elections: "The Anti Fascist Elections"
DDR_the_anti_fascist_elections_desc: "And thus, the party is finally unified. The disagreements between our comrades have been muzzled, and our united front is secured. However, the work is far from over, and our status as the vanguard of the revolution must be secured even further! In order to bolster and galvanize our supporters, as well as finally secure our legitimacy to the rest of the world, elections must be organized.\n\nOver thirty years have passed since the last free elections, and to describe it as a foreign concept for the German people would be a gross understatement. From the loyal worker to the liberated slave, ignorance and uneducated behavior strikes deep in the minds of our people. How can we hope to spread our party values when our people remain apathetic? Comrade Wolf recognizes this, and thus has ordered the mass mobilization of our civil workers to spread our party mantra far and wide. So, toll the bells! Spread the ballot boxes! Election day is coming, and it will be a glorious victory for us all! "

DDR_securing_the_revolution: "Securing the Revolution"
DDR_securing_the_revolution_desc: "There goes a whisper through the world, worker don't you hear it? It is the voice of the war ministers, whispers of the nazis and monopolists, from all continents the fascists shout: \"Death to the People's Republic!\". We must not allow this to happen, the army must be reorganized and renovated, to compete on even terms with the likes of the Japanese and American superpowers, truly representing and uniting the people.\n\nThe assignment of the Marxist-Leninists as set by our revolutionary commission is that the party must guide the rifle, not that the rifle will guide the party. The military force will be supervised by the central committee, and the youth and all of our society must be called into joining our efforts at constructing a professional legion of bolsheviks that will eviscerate the armies of global capitalism."

DDR_found_the_stasi: "Found the Stasi"
DDR_found_the_stasi_desc: "It is clear that a revolution cannot be made with white gloves. We are always within the enemy's field of vision, as our triumph was earned against the reactionaries by a near margin. Warriors, there mustn't be hesitation, as the adversaries of the proletariat and the national-socialist scourge must be eradicated. Even if it means the surrender of freedoms, we have to consolidate a Ministry for State Security.\n\nIt is clear that the capitalist powers will try to divide and conquer us. The threats to our existence are inside and outside, we must build a national central apparatus of networks to control the situation within and build a directorate for international reconnaissance for covert operations that deal with foreign matters. Soon, like the Chekists, we will carry a mighty sword, one that will ensure that order, loyalty, and the complete destruction of fascism will mark the next chapters of our history."

DDR_rooting_out_the_rats: "Rooting out the Rats"
DDR_rooting_out_the_rats_desc: "Some may assume that our new state is secure from any immediate threats from within. They may think that the revolution itself was enough to remove whatever repugnant and shameless nazis still remain in Germany, or at least that they will be too afraid of the new government to try anything too drastic against our government. This is a grave misunderstanding of our current situation.\n\nIf we want to make sure that we are truly safe from counterrevolution, then we must investigate the broader population to ensure that the reactionaries that remain are dealt with. Lists of former employees of organizations such as the SS will be employed to help us track down any fascists that are still in hiding, and we will reward any information that helps us to track down targets. With any luck, the stain of fascism will soon be removed permanently from Germany."

DDR_introduce_centralized_planning: "Introduce Centralized Planning"
DDR_introduce_centralized_planning_desc: "The national-socialist economy was nothing short of a disaster for the German proletariat. From the moment that they took power, the nazis focused on destroying the already small amount of power that the workers had under the Weimar Republic. Unions were destroyed or taken over by the state, wages were frozen, and most of the economy was given to a few incredibly wealthy industrialists.\n\nNow, however, we have the chance to make a more just economy. The five-year plan, the first of its kind to ever happen in Germany, will make sure of this. A new course in the nation's history, this economy will be geared to make sure that the workers, not the wealthy, own the means of production. Furthermore, to assist with the management of the economy, we will begin employing alternative methods such as the use of cybernetics and advanced electronic devices for computation."

DDR_organizing_the_land_reform: "Organizing the Land Reform"
DDR_organizing_the_land_reform_desc: "One wonders how thousands of kilometers of land could be owned by only a handful of people. The answer is quite simple, really: the industrials, and their snake-like Nazi benefactors! Already local councils are organizing the mass incarceration of suspected managers, organizers, and executives that had served under the Nazi government, as part of a larger effort to begin a transition of the republic's collective land to a communal, centrally-planned administration.\n\nThis Bodenreform, as endearingly named by Gerhard Schürer, has become a focal point of discussion across the Volkskammer and Central Committee, with many of Marxstadt's politicians on how such a monumental change to Germany’s primary economy would be approached. However, no matter creed or ideology, every representative in Marxstadt agrees on one simple fact: Reform had to be done now, and it had to be done thoroughly. No more compromises. We must transform Germany's golden fields, or be swept away by the sands of history."

DDR_and_the_assembly_declares: "And the Assembly Declares..."
DDR_and_the_assembly_declares_desc: "What is a state without its foundations, especially one that will become so centralized as our future Marxist-Leninist utopia? Comrade Wolf realizes this, and thus has spoken his intentions clearly; a constitution is needed, post haste! After so many hardships over these past few months, he has declared our nation to be ready for a constitutional convention, which will see the drafting and approval of our founding documents by a special session of the Volkskammer, whilst the Central Committee oversees the procedures.\n\nThis Constitution of the German People’s Republic will be the cornerstone on which our nation shall be built. From provisions that allocate national and local authority to the very rights that our comrades will be bestowed with, the monumental stakes here are clear to see. If all goes well, our people will soon live happily and free, knowing that their lives, their families, and their labors are forever guaranteed to be safe and secure under a caring and functional government. "

DDR_the_1966_socialist_constitution: "The Socialist Constitution"
DDR_the_1966_socialist_constitution_desc: "After all the voices were heard and all amendments were ratified in the German People's Congress, the time has arrived for the Central Committee to review, expand, correct and promulgate a genuinely socialist constitution for our republic. Only decisive action may forever cement our objective of safeguarding human liberty and rights, reshaping collective and economic life in accordance with the principles of social justice, serving social progress no matter the cost, and promoting a secure peace and amity with all peoples.\n\nThis new constitution will be approved through the new democratic institution, via popular referendum, to introduce the new organizations of state authority, the new principles of education and healthcare, the new socialist economic and one-party order, the popular representative body through the Laender and the Volkskammer, coupled with fundamental rights of the citizens. It begins a campaign against sexual, religious, and racial inequality while outlawing prejudice."

#Country Events
ddr_init.1.t: "Unterwegs!"
ddr_init.1.d: "For centuries, the army of Germany had been one that was not fighting on the side of the people, but rather against them. The ministers, the power-hungry bourgeoisie, sent millions to die for imperialist wars and ordered atrocities under the nazi-fascist regime. It will be a truly herculean task to remove this stench, alter the popular perception and profoundly change how our military force operates. Although we have gained experience in warfare through the civil war and the revolution, there is still arduous work ahead.\n\nWhile seasoned communist revolutionaries like Heinz Hoffman and Erich Mielke initiated the Volksarmee, now it was a much larger force, as a compromise had to be made to pardon and include some who became our agents or proved their allegiance to the new army. Such were Heinz Kessler, Willi Stoph, Fritz Streletz, and many others who once served on the other side, but now were integrated into the ranks of the organized force.\n\nTransitioning from a revolutionary guerrilla group to a professional army that would act in securing the streets, and the borders, to protect a nation from foreign invaders and serve it dutifully was now a mission that Friedrich Dickel and Erich Mielke faced. As Mielke moved closer to state and political affairs, he announced the creation of the Landstreitkräfte, the Volksarmee's own ground-based military branch, and left under Marshal Willi Stoph. Soon, he renounced leadership of the NVA itself, leaving it to Marshal Heinz Kessler.\n\nWilli Stoph and Heinz Kessler had the experience, the vision, and the will to truly construct an army that would be comparable if not superior to the extinct Wehrmacht they once served in. Obviously, Erich Mielke kept a close eye on them, but that was not that much of a bother for now. They declared extinct other smaller guerrilla organizations, integrating them into the army and organizing the rank system further, with representatives of the New Guard, like Meinhof, and of the Old Guard, like Hoffman, gaining representation.\nAs guns, artillery, tanks, trucks, and other mechanized or motorized equipment from both the old government and the guerrilla were reorganized and put into use again, The Germans felt that they could defend themselves again and protect their revolution."
ddr_init.1.a: "Soldaten, marsch"

ddr_init.2.t: "Matrosen von Rostock"
ddr_init.2.d: "It wasn't a silent night when Karl Dönitz, Oberbefehlshaber der Marine, was brought beaten, bruised, and with a rope around his mouth. He muffled shouts of anger, as he resisted arrest with every last muscle in his body. The sailors and officers were shocked at the display of strength coming from this 75-year-old man, as he was dragged into a booth where the new chief of what was called the 'Volksmarine', Waldemar Verner, and his advisors, Wilhelm Ehm and Heinz Neukirchen, stood by his side, waiting and observing the situation. Verner was surprised that Dönitz was still alive.\n\nWith his commanding hand extended to the side, he ordered for the once Grand Admiral to have the rope removed from his mouth. As the rope was removed, the first things that came out were not words, but blood and one tooth. After taking a deep breath, Karl simply looked at those who he let go. \"You Bolshevik traitors, so rotten, disgusting j-\" as Karl let out his fury, a sailor hit him with a baton, but Neukirchen intervened. \"Why don't we just execute him, as we did to Raeder?! This is a waste of our time!\" The sailor shouted, but Neukirchen simply gestured for calm. \"He will be tried and his crimes will not go unpunished. For now, let him be.\" The sailor quickly complied, leaving to guard the door.\n\n\"I do not need your pity, you judeo-bolshevik snake. What even is this for? Are you going to try to convince me to become one of you? Or are you going to pardon me so that I can learn?\" Dönitz gave a sarcastic smile. Verner sighed when finally Dönitz noticed where he was. The same prison in Rostock that he had jailed so many before, including Waldemar, was going to be where he would rot until his trial. Weeks passed, and as Dönitz saw his once proud fleet defiled with communist imagery and a brand new flag, the commander's cold eyes let out tears, whilst thousands of German men, in carriers, destroyers, and frigates, fought for what he spent his entire life to prevent."
ddr_init.2.a: "As he sunk, the sailors rose."

ddr_init.3.t: "Rote Flieger"
ddr_init.3.d: "With the large scale reformation of the Volksarmee underway, there was a momentary sense of panic for the various pilot brigades that had defected from the Luftwaffe to serve the revolution. And, as with such fear, rumors festered quickly that the air forces would be absorbed into the army, relegated these pilots serve the whims of those tied to the ground. Others were more optimistic, believing in a completely independent branch that could function independently and serve the People’s Republic in its own right.\n\nOne of these men was Captain Ehrenfest, and high above the outskirts of Karlsruhe, amongst the clouds above, he was soaring. His magnificent craft cut through the clouds like butter, at speeds attainable by few. Its sweeping wings reached towards the skies as if attempting to touch the heavens themselves.\n\nTo Ehrenfest, the jet was no machine. No, it was a living, breathing being that spat out enough bullets to tear open a tank, whilst slicing through the atmosphere at a pace threatening the speed of sound. For such a mighty warrior of the skies, what justice was there to relegate him to mere support for the army? Had they not fought an entire revolution to cast aside such traditional, benign behavior? This was the future of warfare, and it would either take the center stage of it all or be swept away by the tides of history.\n\nOnce landed, Ehrenfest cracked open his cock pit to meet the face of Heinz Kessler, just below the plane's fuselage. If there was any man in Germany left to serve, he would gladly serve Kessler, for he had a more… balanced way of thinking when it came to the future of the revolution’s military. Realizing what his presence here meant, he quickly took off his flight equipment and clambered out of the aircraft to meet him. Once eye to eye, he took a deep breath, preparing for the best and worst news to come. \"So?\" he asked, with a slight tinge of jittery excitement. Before he could even speak, Kessler nodded, a subtle smirk rising on his lips. \n\n\"Yes, captain. The Central Committee just voted on it this morning; it looks like we’ll be getting our independent air force, after all.\" He popped open his briefcase, handing Ehrenfest a sizeable folder. Reassignment orders. For once, he couldn't be happier to see them."
ddr_init.3.a: "To the skies, comrades!"

ddr_init.4.t: "Breath of Fresh Air"
ddr_init.4.d: "Heinrich sighed as looked out over the motely force that had rallied to his banner ever since the fucking Communists had taken Germania. The failure that represented still galled Heinrich. Not that it mattered now. National Socialism had failed, this world was one where the strong replaced the weak and the strong had risen. Turning around he put on his cap as he marched off to do his duty as the last member of the Wehrmacht. Behind him he felt his fellow soldiers fall in, their discontent radiating from them. He couldn’t judge them. He knew that there were still groups fighting for the Aryan Race. But they had failed, and thus it was time for their duty to end.\n\nThe Communists were waiting for him at a small table surrounded by armed guards he marched with the Prussian precision that had made Germany great. Taking his place at the table Heinrich grabbed the pen that was presented to him and signed the document of surrender. Passing it along to be countersigned by his fellow soldiers he rose as the pen was placed down.\n\n“So, you’ve done it. The Führer’s legacy is for naught. My father’s sacrifice was for nothing.” “Your father died so that millions of innocents could be slaughtered. That’s no sacrifice.” “He fought for GERMANY, he fought for the REICH!” Heinrich snarled back at the Communist, sitting across from him.\n\nSilence fell for a few minutes as his men laid down their arms around him and the scattered Swastikas they still had were taken down. Heinrich had done what the might of Britain, America, and the Bolsheviks had not. He had ended the Thousand Year Reich. He had ended the triumph of the Aryan race over the lesser races infesting the world.\n\nStanding up he drew his pistol from his belt to hand it in. As he placed it down it felt heavier then it ever had before."
ddr_init.4.a: "History has a heavy hand."

ddr_init.5.t: "Wolf and Party"
ddr_init.5.d: "It was the first day of Wolf in his office, and as the man walked across the streets of Marxstadt, he was met with confused looks. The 'man without a face', as he was called by his enemies, had finally appeared in public. Of course, with guards in every corner, either surrounding him or hiding between the destroyed streets of the capital. Many didn't understand why this man was held in such high regard. Was he going to be one of the ministers? Was he an associate of Reimann or, perhaps, one of Mielke's men?\n\nIt only dawned on them when they saw him entering the damaged Volkshalle, which was being rebuilt and renamed to become what engineers called the 'Palace of the Republic', whilst the more enthusiastic revolutionaries called it 'The People's Palace'. No one except for construction workers had set foot in that broken structure in weeks. Everything indicated that this man could only be the famed Chairman of the SED, 'Markus Wolf.' A crowd of interested Marxstadters quickly formed from the streets, trying to get a close glimpse of the fabled spymaster, but to no avail.\n\nThis meeting was not one that was going to be announced to the public, for it only reunited the high commission and the most relevant figures of the revolution. Generals, ministers, and representatives of various important groups formed what was temporarily the governing commission, but some of these men stood out and were somewhat heroes on their own merits and were considered by the rest of the revolutionaries to be ones that would retain their posts.\n\nAccording to the official reports and as the news spread, what was discussed in the meeting were the immediate actions that were to be taken for the transition to a people's republic. The officialization of revolutionary symbols, the implementation of various policies, and actions towards a 'de-Nazification' program. As it was announced through radio and television, the legislation that was put in place by the revolutionaries in their 'Red Rhine', was now official throughout all German lands. "
ddr_init.5.a: "A new era, perhaps?"

ddr_init.6.t: "Roter Nachmittag"
ddr_init.6.d: "Stefan Foehrkolb lived his entire life under the Third Reich, from when he was born in Hitler's years as Führer, he was raised seeing conquest after conquest, as his nation became the world's hegemon. As he was blonde, athletic, and always exceeding expectations in all classes, he enjoyed all the privileges that the system had to offer. He would have probably fought for the Wehrmacht if it wasn't for the tragedies that were losing his parents during the civil war and then losing his sister, an activist for democracy, killed during the 'Brandenburg Gate Massacre'.\n\nStefan was only one of many who suffered the consequences of the collapse of the Reich, a part of the disgruntled masses that now were eager to overthrow it, that were touched by the words, the propaganda, and the speeches that the revolutionaries repeated through every battle. Dedicating the rest of his life to assisting those who he now called 'comrades', he learned the depressing truth of the atrocities that Hitler, his party, and his army helped perpetuate across the world.\n\nHis goals and beliefs changed simply from an attempt to avenge Petra, as he began to sympathize with the ideals of communism as the nation turned red. Many like him were initially reluctant but figured the only way they could move on with their lives and ensure a bright tomorrow was to plow, build and create like never before. A free generation had risen up, one that would bring new life to the land of Marx, Engels and Thälmann.\n\nThe skies filled with smog began to clear and the streets once filled with bodies, weaponry, and rubble were now being cleaned. The people's blood, sweat, and tears dripped all across the lands, as the work of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, started to lay the foundation for a society that would truly break away from the old and start anew.\n\nAn era would end, and a new cycle begins, spinning the unstoppable wheel of history. Stefan would have his hands full with an engineering project in Leipzig this afternoon, nonetheless, it all felt worth it."

ddr_risen.1.t: "Facing The Future"
ddr_risen.1.d: "Niels K. Schroth woke up, just as he did like any other day. Early as well, mind you, even if it was a Saturday. He brushed his teeth, used the toilet, fetched the paper on his doorstep, and left his small apartment to use his ration card for some bread.\n\nHe was one of the luckier ones on his block, for he actually had a place to call home; his neighbors couldn’t really say the same, with their homes left as shelled-out husks during the revolution. Still, the government provided a nice shelter for them just three blocks down. Good food, bedding, and friendly enough neighbors. Plus, crime had finally decreased to the point where he could walk the streets without being throttled by a police officer, demanding papers he always forgot to carry. It brought stability, he supposed in his head.\n\nAs Niels turned the corner towards the bread shop, he noted the ruined apartments had more workers than usual. Even stranger, many of his co-workers from the steel mill were there, lifting rubble and shoveling dirt and muck from the wreckage! They seemed so… airy about it all. They were simply chatting by and by, about rumors in the workplace and familial drama, with smiles on their faces throughout the hard labor. It even got a snicker from Niels as he went into earshot of a joke from Sarah, the mill’s manager’s secretary, whom he fancied dearly. “Strange,” he thought to himself. Never had he thought the mass reconstruction of the city could be taken so lightly.\n\nNiels got his bread that day. He ate it, listened to the radio, read a book, bartered for a coat using his few intact shoes, and ate his dinner. On Sunday, he woke up just as he did like any other day. This made it even more startling seeing a soldier on his doorstep, handing him papers and demanding that he attend regular civil work on the outskirts of the city, for the next five or so weeks. After what he saw yesterday, perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad."

Tens of millions would be seeing and hearing this event on their television and radios, citizens of the newly founded republic, and even workers from Tokyo, New York, and other cities.\n\nCelebrations were held to commemorate the defeat of fascism and the revolution, as 'Die Internationale' was performed by the Zentralorchester der NVA before a reserved and soothing voice introduced itself to the listeners.  The man speaking in the 'Rundfunk' was not simply any government official or a general, it was the chairman himself, Markus Wolf. Even though there was no more 'Reichsführer', the 'Führerprinzip' survived as an idea, as many would still admire and respect the leader more than the party.\n\nAfter the initial adress, the long-awaited speech itself began.\"Today, I remind you that, the Reich is gone, but Germany lives and the German people prevail. A new era has begun, an era of reconstruction, progress, and revolution. Gone is the era of warmongers and butchers, for there will be no more slaves, only the united workers, through socialism, can bring a true end and rectify the barbaric past to the shameful stain of Nazism across Europe and allow security and peace to flourish.\n\"The party, the army, and all our institutions will be of total assistance to the proletariat as we overcome an enormous obstacle once again. Surely, we will act to destroy the fascist snake, but our goal is to bring about a time without any more crimes against humanity. Our main struggle begins now, as we seek to stamp out the enemy from within and guarantee that Europe does not suffer through dark times once again. We have buried fascism and the atom shields us from imperialism.\"\n\"Our revolution stands here on the shoulders of giants: Marx, Engels, Lenin, Luxemburg, Liebknecht, Thälmann and Pieck. I wish all workers of the world an excellent afternoon.\" As the speech ended, 'Auferstanden aus Ruinen', the new anthem, was performed by the orchestra. "

Seven soldiers were selected for this squad, which was but one squad out of fifteen. Tomorrow, these fifteen squads would sweep across the Hessen countryside to flush out one of the largest “Werwolf” resistance groups left after the revolution, now limited to but a few isolated strongholds. It was a miracle that they hadn’t reached the cities. Perhaps the Volkspolizei had their work cut out-“Commander present!” Jakob’s body immediately stiffened, alongside his comrades. A rather short, bespectacled man then entered the room, approaching the map of the Hessen region strewn across the center table. He stared at it, for only but a moment, before his eyes found Jakob’s.\n“Who is the squad officer here?” The captain, Oskar, approached. “I am, commander.” His eyes went up and down him, before he grunted softly. It was then that another man, presumably his aide, entered and handed him a clipboard. With little fanfare, he dropped it onto the table. The names of cities across Hesse, and even some in Bavaria, were scribbled across the clipboard’s parchment.\n\n“I’m glad to say that the hunt’s size has been adjusted. We’ll be covering the cities, along with the countryside.” Jakob could feel the air in the room change with this statement; even Oskar seemed unsettled, and a pause drew the room for a moment. “..Commander, I don’t.. We simply don’t have enough squads to cover that much area. “ said Oskar, leaning against the table. Jakob could’ve sworn that he saw a smirk from the commander before he turned to Oskar. “That won’t be a problem, captain. I’ve also received word that the Central Committee would like fifty more squads assigned to our operation.” An even greater silence poised the room for what felt like minutes, before he chuckled. “Have they not toyed with us for long enough? They started this, and I’ll be damned if we don’t finish it here and now.” He waved his aide to leave, before looking back to Oskar. \"Don't you agree, captain?\""

The attack was to commence at 1:30, and Volkspolizei units would converge on the compound from all sides, snuffing them out in one overwhelming blow.\n\nAt least, that was the plan.\n\nInstead, at 1:04, the Forest teams were met with unplanned machine gun fire from the compound. They were almost completely routed as the men just behind the front of the assault were covered in blood and bone fragments, before they too were struck down by the ensuing carnage.\n\nAt 1:11 the Forest teams rallied with the reserves and settled in for a siege that would last until sundown the next day. From dawn to dusk, the machine guns fired to fend off the Volkspolizei, all the while the Volkspolizei fired back, tit for tat. Over, and over. A cycle of painful death and little advancement.\n\nLogistics proved the decisive factor as the fascist's machine guns ran out of ammunition, whilst the Volkspolizei were resupplied via local roads.\n\nAs the machine guns went silent, the fascists descended into their bunkers, sending the compound into silence. For fear of destroying valuable intelligence, flamethrowers were not used, instead the Volkspolzei would have to enter the compound to clear out the fascists.\n\nWith a bang, the Volkspolizei rushed into the compound. They encountered no resistance, and instead they found the fascists hanging from the low ceiling."

They would march to the streets, singing old anthems and hymns of the classic Marxist caliber, and begin burning anything and everything that was emblazoned with a swastika. Sometimes, they would drag people with them. Golo was reminded of this with another kick to the torso, forcing a groan out from his tired throat.\n\n“Fascist pig-dog! Where's your father?!” shouted his assaulter, receiving cheers of agreement from the crowd. Golo winced. His father died during the revolution, not that he cared much about him. He was an author, prolific in Stuttgart, specializing in racial studies for the city’s university. Golo could never agree with his rabble. He hadn’t talked to him ever since-\n\nThe assaulter grabbed his shirt, dragging him onto his feet. “Your family is nothing but brownshirt trash.” as he said this, his eyes drew to the fire. “...Perhaps we should burn you, then!” he said, a wicked smile growing on his face. He could feel the dancing flames growing closer to his back until the man was suddenly grabbed by the shoulder. A police officer, thought Golo. Thank the lord.\n\n“Let him go, comrade!” he said before looking at Golo. “He’s not worth it.” His assaulter relented slightly, receiving a stern lock from the officer, before he simply let Golo fall to the ground. “Next time, pig-dog.” he spat out before disappearing into the crowd, leaving Golo on the streets, bloodied and battered, to sob in pain and guilt.

It wasn't long before the man met his fate in an extrajudicial execution, when forces under General Meinhof's command acted during their patrol.\n\nThe 'Braunbuch', as it was called, was a book compiling the names and crimes of the Nazi officials during the Third Reich in all areas: State, Economy, Administration, Army, Justice, and Science. Written by SED politician Albert Norden and mass published by the party itself, it quickly gained notoriety, being translated into other languages, such as Polish and English, reaching millions of Germans and even some antifascist foreigners.\n\nFor almost an entire month, all that most news channels reported was about the horrid truth being revealed, with the effects of convincing part of the 'reactionary' masses to reconsider their views and ensure even more support for the socialist government by those who were neutral or already sympathizers. A process of telling the 'True History of Germany' in schools, universities, and through the media would begin.\n\nAs the intelligence services began to dig deeper and the media spoke louder, more and more prominent NSDAP members and sympathizers were arrested, beaten, or ostracized, becoming commonly known that a 'Day of Justice' would come about, to ensure that those monsters would pay for their crimes. Not only that, but the usually sturdy German had become more empathetic, as tales of people who were of Jewish or Polish descent being apologized to on the street or given gifts.\n\nThree decades of propaganda sowed a tree of antisemitism, eugenics, antibolshevism, ultranationalism, and disregard for human life that allowed atrocities like the Shoah to happen.

The recently founded The Supreme Court of the German People's Republic, under the Supreme Public Prosecutor of the Republic, Josef Streit, began the trials of the representatives and collaborators of the Third Reich for all of their crimes during their reign over Europe and other parts of the world.\n\nIn charge of the defense, was a very nervous Friedrich Wolff. The son of a Jewish doctor, he was advised by Friedrich Karl Kaul, another prominent Marxist lawyer, not to partake in the defense, but he accepted it as a challenge to prove the judicial integrity of the republic and to begin building the foundations of a new legal system. \"How the mighty have fallen...\" whispered Wolff, seeing Dönitz, Globke, Speidel, Gehlen, Gille, and many others.\n\nLong days went on as the court allowed for opening statements and the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecutors kept the tide extremely in their favor. \"There are still many unpunished, the sentences must be executed now, the people want justice!\" As popular pressure pushed more, some of the most ruthless killers of humanity, torturers, and many involved in projects such as Zyklon B or Lebensraun were sent to the 'Speziallager' to be shot.\n\nMountains of paperwork accumulated, as court sessions ran, this trial intrigued some observers from the OFN as it also dwelled in international matters when it put into the forefront the crimes many in the NSDAP, Wehrmacht, the companies, and other of the various arms of the Reich committed in foreign lands. The executions were ramping up, and the most prominent members, like Dönitz, were hanged for their crimes.\n\nThe defense was initially disorganized, but it was able to reduce some of the sentences to rehabilitation and imprisonment instead of life without parole or the death penalty. Their efforts relied on evidence of insignificance and coercion of their defendants, trying to make them look sympathetic and imply reeducation would show the triumph of socialism.\n\nAs thousands of monsters lay dead or in chains, Hamburg was only the beginning.

Even in this frozen world, the people would be warmed by the ever-extending embrace of the party.\n\nThe first official congress of the party would be announced and the two leaders appeared to the other prominent members. Max Reimann, was the President of the Volkskammer, the parliamentary organ that was still to be organized by the elections and would replace the Reichstag. Reimann's position also granted him control of the previously mentioned Länderkammer. The smiling leader began his speech after Die Internationale was sung by every member.\n\n\"In this age, we, the defenders of mankind and peace, raised to life by Lenin's spirit and inspired by Thälmann's sacrifice, the workers of all land, have seized control from the howling hyenas of war. Builders, on guard, let us construct a cradle with courage and love against the enemies of the people, against the revisionists and deceivers. I am ready to fight for our unity to my last dying breath, alongside my comrade and respectable Chairman, Markus Wolf.\"\n\nAfter thunderous applause, it was time for Markus Wolf himself to address the party. First, he organized the principles of the party and affirmed its supremacy above the army and the ministries.\"Where there is a comrade, the party is there too.\" That was the mantra, as becoming a member of the party would not only become accessible but be widely promoted, with even a youth wing - which he called the 'Freie Deutsche Jugend', being created.\n\nAlthough nominally the party had been a coalition of antifascist revolutionaries, the committee was dominated by the hardliners, who were quick to impose theoretical and democratic centralism, enforcing the party line and merging smaller groups and federations into federations and centers loyal to the Thälmannite brand of 'Marxism-Leninism', the ideology of Spartacism.

It had only been a few months since Ernestas was liberated from that… accursed place in Klaipėda. He had seen his wife die in a field of sand and pebbles, the sun beating down on him as he fell to his knees in tears. Though he was now free, the world had become so confusing. How could he adjust? Would there ever be a place for a man like him?\n\nBeyond his notice, a sharply-dressed party official approached a podium on the hall’s stage, tapping a microphone jutting out from it. “Attention! Attention, please!” He called to the people. Their chatter quickly died down, and the room went silent.\n\n“Wonderful. Let me be the first to congratulate your new-found camaraderie around you, as well as your emancipation under the people’s republic.” He bore a wide smile, pausing as if to expect applause. None came. “...Well, I know that many of you are quite confused about our system of government, as well as the coming elections some of you have heard about. You’ve been through so much, and the least we can do is teach you how to serve your republic.” Still smiling, he then left the podium to present a small, slotted box at the front of the stage.\n\nBefore Ernestas knew it, hours had gone by, with the deluge of information overwhelming him. He barely understood who was even in charge, much less voting in an election! In the end, the party official allowed everyone to put their slip of paper, or \"ballot\", into the box, and they were free to go.The next morning, Ernestas awoke to distant cheers from outside. He left his small apartment, taking a newspaper set near his door, only to see the same headline on each page: “SOCIALIST UNITY PARTY VICTORIOUS; 657 SEATS, INDEPENDENTS GAIN 43”.

He was ready to serve the instrument of power of the working class, the army that would protect the workers and farmers, that would shatter fascism! This force, initially all-volunteer, had introduced conscription and one of the conscripts was Apsel. However, he was adamant about serving, he wanted to make his father, an anti-fascist, proud of him and also his mother, although she didn't care about politics.\n\nAmong the thousands of men serving in the Nationale Volksarmee, many had served previously in the Wehrmacht, but mostly in the lower or middle ranks, as generals and such were either executed, fled, or imprisoned. But a sizeable amount were members of the early revolutionary squadrons that stormed palaces and prefectures and fortified the Red Rhine, the so-called 'guerrilla'. Apsel would watch the battle of Leipzig in awe from the windows of his home.\n\nThe tanks would sing thunderous songs, as the people of Leipzig would wave to the troops, most of them with their new uniforms, patches, and the band following along. It seems that most of the changes introduced by the high command of the Volksarmee were focused on trying not only to rising the number of fresh new recruits but to improve the image of the army, as the people would wave, give flowers, shake hands and hug the soldiers like they were family.\n\nA small child would be amazed when she saw a female soldier, saying how she wanted to be a soldier herself. The picture of her being picked up by the soldier would be taken and used for propaganda nationwide, as Apsel observed, some members of the Länderkammer were using the opportunity to be with the soldiers and appeal to the people. If it was an act or not, he could care less, as the euphoria was amazing.\n\nEspecially when his eyes met with the love of his life, another soldier, a girl that went by the name of Monika. Now, all the different types of uniforms, the corp colors, the awards, ranks, and periodicals were irrelevant to him.

An ambitious, high-ranking one at that, but a bureaucrat nonetheless. Whilst these thoughts danced in his head, Schürer’s eyes were drawn to his office’s window, where the flickering lights of Marxstadt flickered across the streets and the skyline in harmonious equality.\n\nTo Schürer, it was a blueprint. The smoldering wrecks of destroyed buildings and razed streets spelt an opportunity to build something even greater; something that all of the German people could appreciate and utilize equally. Of course, implementing full economic planning wouldn’t happen overnight, but the work that he did tonight would set the foundations for the new People’s Reconstruction Authority to build upon.\n\nIt was lucky then that Reimann and Schürer saw eye to eye on the subject matter. He knew better than anyone that the Central Committee wasn’t exactly… unified in their opinion on how to begin our transition to a true Leninist economy. Some saw wisdom in Luxembourgist thought, believing decentralized control to lead to a smooth, pain-free movement between economic forms. Others, god help their souls, believe that Bukharin’s ideals could be implemented more correctly under a “German” administration.\n\nSchürer grumbled slightly. The past is past. Why won't they accept that?\n\nTo decentralize would bring uncertainty, and to revert back to Bukharin’s unfathomably byzantine concept of Leninist economics would doom the German people before they even knew it. Why even bother with the mistakes of the past? Is it not reactionary to reject the innovation of the future for the faux comfort of past ideals? Schürer had to convince them.

As millions of laborers rose up or were liberated in the revolution, the conglomerates attempted to resist the proletarian offensive, failing miserably and having most of their assets seized by the newly established worker's state.\n\nHermann Josef Abs was the first to go, amid a pitiful attempt at a getaway, his vessel was intercepted and there was no mercy shown to him, nor was there any in the seizure of IG Farbens. Ernst Von Siemens, the Speerite and so-called 'pragmatist', made the quiet effort to try and plead for mercy, however, his usage of slave labor, even if reduced, and his cooperation with Speer cemented his execution.\n\nAs it is known, the Werwolf movement is a frightful issue in our society and after some investigation, it was found that one of its main bankrollers was Friedrich Flick. He had hidden his crimes against humanity and his genocidal affairs from Speer and Tresckow, but he knew we would bring it to light, so he prepared an escapade through the ratlines into Burgundy, as he saw his coal and steel factories nationalized.\n\nHe would have succeeded if it wasn't for his temper. Accustomed to ordering slaves around, the head of Daimler-Benz had a fiery argument with the hired Werwolves, allowing our intelligence to locate them. The execution of the mercenaries and Friedrich was a bloody venture, as expected when dealing with the SS-Werwolf, yet we consider it was worth it, as we recovered gold, jewelry, and steel in the tycoon's baggage.\n\nNow only remained Edmund Geilenberg and some directors.

The availability and prices of goods were announced, and there was no competition between the brands.\n\nTo the average citizen that once had access to the same products, it was simply a change in a coat of paint, as it wasn't Volkswagen, it was now Trabant and Wartburg, being produced by the VEB Sachsenring instead. However, the former slaves and the once disenfranchised masses were glued to the screens seeing the watches, clothes, utensils, wines and all that socialism had to offer. It was not Fanta, it was Vita Cola!\n\nThe main industry and electronic sectors were also advertised, as the expropriation of them and the rule of factories by the working class and the party in unison was cheered as a glorious victory of Marxism-Leninism. Electronics, microelectronics, and data processing industries were shown alongside the large industrial complexes and enormous factories as the future of a possible 'electronic socialism.'\n\nThe corporatist model had been extinct and substituted by the new 'electronically centrally planned' socialist model of Germany, even at the local level. From the small shops and malls, shopping malls and distribution centers had regulated prices and worked under the state organs of regulations, while the agrarian countryside, which was in the process of conflict with the landlords and slave owners, also cooperated with their own organs.\nThe beloved Fernsehfunk also had channels dedicated to children's cartoons, sports, military propaganda, the ideals of Spartacism, healthcare and also anti-racism and anti-sexism campaigns.

Grey figures walked past her their features indistinguishable the only similarity is a familiar red, white, and black armband. The mother seemed to grow older the more passed her, her hair turning grey and the cries of her child increasing more and more.\n\nThen a color figure entered the screen. A young man bearing the now common SED symbols walked towards the mother he offered her his hand and a key.

Unlike his cold older brother, the director was invested in emotional, melancholic stories, and this piece was a space for his talent.\n\nThe film itself was nothing new but the exhortation against homelessness at the beginning stayed with Wilhelm as he rose from the cinema and entered the streets.

His legacy of relentless battles against fascism has earned him a legendary position amongst the Volksrepublik and now with the recent creation of the Ministerium für Staatssicherheit, his authority is ever higher.\n\nReunited with the Volkspolizei and other divisions that would form the core of the 'Stasi', the announcements were made clear. The idea was to create a sword and shield for the party, that would serve the SED in its ventures and act according to the constitution, the penal code, and the civil code. However, Erich Mielke and his militarist faction had a different plan in their mind for how the ministry would operate, they wouldn't make treachery of it, of course, but propose their ideas gradually.\n\nAs the area precincts, the locations of detachments, the question of censorship, and the line principle began to be discussed, a map was outlined. Naturally, the conversation gets to the main concern, the fifth column, the Werwolf. It was of course agreed that they must be ruthless with them, that it must be 'all covered'. As the discussion stopped, Mielke began his speech. \"We must be firmly disciplined like our Prussian forefathers before us. Veterans lay within our enemy's ranks.\"\"No mercy with an enemy of the party and an enemy of the state.\" As the conversations went on, quotes and phrases impacted the officers who wouldn't break even a sweat, they were mesmerized as they were given a new duty. Even if Erich wasn't the brightest politician, he knew his way around propaganda. \"We must shatter all their forts even if it fills rivers with blood!

They would probably be starting to grow fearful of his power, and worry that he may, one day, be able to challenge their position. Mielke hoped that Wolf, Modrow, and the rest would see reason, eventually. Could they not see that the fight against fascism required drastic measures?\n\nFor men like Erich, there stood no other way. To truly clear out this infestation of Werwolves, they would need to clear out florests to rid the fatherland of their nests. It reminded him of a quote, said by a man he admired: \"When you chop wood, chips fly.\" There would be consequences, but alas, there could be threats everywhere lurking amidst their crepuscular woods.\n\nHowever, all this would not worry him for too long.

That the proletariat organized as the ruling class would organize all instruments of production under the state using its political supremacy, that it would build an economy by and for the exploited, not by the exploiters, one free from the yoke of capitalist crisis and bourgeoisie corruption and hierarchies, achieving true development.\n\nThe planned economy, which would be born from workers' control of the state apparatus, never came to be in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Instead, when Vladimir Lenin wisely took a step backward and transitioned from the semi-feudal Imperial system and developed the capitalist basis, to allow for a steady recovery under the New Economic Policy, his promised 'two-step forwards' to socialism didn't arrive.\n\nAfter his tragic passing away, his successors, who in Gerhard Schürer's vision, were not only terrible economists but lousy Marxists, did not continue the process of nationalization, industrialization, and collectivization, but let the power of the small landowners and small entrepreneurs grow. From that point on, the USSR entrenched itself into the capitalist system and collapsed politically and economically with it.\n\nSchürer had worked and received a lot of papers, he had lost nights working and even directly called Wolf asking for a bigger team to better support industries and make the breakthrough they wanted. Although Germany was smaller than the Soviet Union, the population was comparable and the economy was way more developed and larger. There was no precedent for planning, except for some early Soviet writings, references from the distant Joseph Stalin, and...then, the nervous economist smiled.\n\nAfter reading Soviet and German archives, he found the works of Anatoly Kitov, about an Economic Automated Management System. He published this book with a certain Glushkov and Zhdanov. It was perfect for a nationwide information and planning network and with the massive electronics industry and computer system, it was feasible to implement the plan gradually. Announcing it on television, he coined the terms: 'Electronics Socialism' and 'Cybernetic Economy'."

ddr_risen.19.t: "Tractor's Harvest"
ddr_risen.19.d: "Amazing. Plauer's local council didn't lie: they had some pretty modern equipment ready for distribution. A fleet of \"Fortschritt\" E 512 combine harvesters, 15 strong, stood in front of Gustav and his newly-assigned communal workers. Engineers from the inner city milled about the scene, preparing the harvesters for deployment and making the last minute spit-shines.\n\n\"This is the future, Gustav!\" chuckled Robert, a friend of Gustav and head of Plauer's agricultural committee. \"No more second-rate machines, whilst the best are saved only for the richest landowners in Germany. Marxstadt promised action, and by God, we'll answer in tandem.\" He gave a smirk to Gustav, before being dragged away by an engineer carrying quite the amount of papers.\n\nIt was funny, really. Gustav still remembered this farm, back in the '59, when it was staffed only by slaves and their drivers. He worked there, sure, but he just managed inventory. He hated that farm deeply, yet he ironically needed it; his family needed money. He remembered the cries of pain he'd hear outside of his small office, the intermittent gunshots in the distant fields. After the revolution, he was quickly jailed for \"collaborative efforts\", but Robert managed to personally save him from further punishment. It was only a few months later that he was asked to become manager of the entire facility.\n\nIt would be different, he told himself. Endless hours would never happen again. There would be peace and harmony amongst his workers, along with equal opportunity for advancement. Gone were the days of nepotism and autocracy in the workplace; this was an equal society, and he would ensure the best for everyone under him. Gustav's thoughts were then cut in twain by the sudden roar of a harvester's engine near him. There was Robert, laughing heartily in the driver's seat, as engineers cheered for their success. Gustav smiled. Indeed, it would be different."

ddr_risen.20.t: "Principles of Anti-Fascism"
ddr_risen.20.d: "The Volkskammer was always a lively place. Police and military officers alike stood at guard in each corridor and doorway, whilst clerks filed in and out of the People’s Chamber, where hundreds of Germany’s finest politicians, bureaucrats, and political wranglers gathered to argue on some of the most critical decisions that steer the German ship of state. From the most loyal labourer of our glorious socialist republic, to the vilest traitor lurking in the shadows, one thing could be agreed: Germany had never seen more open politicking for decades.\n\nFor the last week, though, the Volkskammer has been… livelier than before, albeit with less positivity than one would assume from a nation’s legislative body. Some of the finest deputies of the people gathered to discuss and argue on certain provisions of the newborn constitution. Whilst all present were unified in their commitment for a better, caring Germany, their methods to reach such a state were quite differentiated.\n\n“Reactionary pigs! You wouldn’t know the first thing about Marxist theory if it had slapped you across the face!”\n\n“I will not stand this kind of rabble! Won’t somebody detain this traitor already?!”\n\nA shoe flew. It knocked someone in the head, ringing out a cry. Who threw that shoe? It wouldn’t matter, anyway; the soldiers had already intervened, dragging an awfully silent representative from his chair and out of the room. This only exacerbated problems, and the uproar in the air only increased in magnitude by the minute. Max Reimann could barely hear himself think. \nIt took several long, grueling hours later, and several fits of rage from Reimann himself, in which a constitution had emerged from the stormclouds of politics. Finally, under the united front of anti-fascists, socialists, and progressives alike, we have taken the first true step towards the utopia Marx had promised so long ago!"

ddr_risen.21.t: "Lied Vom Vaterland"
ddr_risen.21.d: "It was finally a beautiful, red morning, for Markus Wolf. The march of the joyful men of his country could be heard outside, he stared at the window for a couple minutes silently before a knock on the door caught him off guard. An interesting letter was given, it was specifically a communique concerning the question of the results of the referendum on the constitution of the German People's Republic and they were positive, specifically, eighty-percent positive.\n\nA straightforward question, 'Are you for a new constitution to build the German nation a road to a future of peace firmly based upon the principles of the anti-fascist, democratic and socialist ideology?', which the answers were either, a resounding yes or a calming no. Although Erich Mielke insisted that the Stasi needed to spy on whoever voted no since they had chances of being Werwolves, Markus Wolf protected the democratic process and insisted on the supremacy of the party and the SED over any military apparatus.\n\nThe day of the promulgation was one of celebrations throughout the nation, as the Freie Deutsche Jugend, initiated with their youthful fervor and indomitable force, then the Volksarmee, who across generations, show protection and honor. Only years ago, Germany was in shambles, it was a nation dominated by vultures, butchers, and criminals who turned it into a horrid place filled with nothing but smog, piles of bodies, division, and regression.\n\nNow, all those hearts were beating so free, there were so many people with love: workers, farmers, Germans, Poles, Czechs, Christians, Jews, Men, Women, Children, and even homosexuals, even though they weren't accepted by all those in the party. Nonetheless, they could all announce to the world that they are two things: comrades and proud citizens of the German People's Republic.\nThe new articles would come into effect, being promulgated by the Chairman, which shed a single tear while determining the new administrative policies, uncharacteristic of him. Nonetheless, principles of trade unions, labor, taxation, compulsory and free education, the rights of women and motherhood, the new economic order, and the new political and social order were all established by 100 articles, closing a dark chapter in German history and opening a bright new future."

ddr_risen.101.t: "Where The Red Rhine Flows"
ddr_risen.101.d: "During the most bloody and tumultuous days along what we call the 'Red Rhine', many martyrs fells, heroes rose to prominence fighting against the Reich, blood spilled into the river and all flowed into one place - the Netherlands. Under occupation, known as the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, the native Dutch resistance was put down by the various collaborators and their factions. Yet, we were informed that it was reorganizing and still existed in some cities of their country when it began supporting our struggle. \n\nWhen the Third Reich collapsed for the second time, so did the Einheitspakt and the revolution was the final nail in the coffin. Yet, these countries did not erupt into civil wars once again or tried their chance at a crusade against our forces, they kept their army at home to subjugate the local uprisings that happened when our revolution occurred. That was not enough in Poland, but the Dutch fascist boot keeps crushing the neck of their people. \n\nNow, the Volksarmee and all the branches of our military services have been reorganized to not only protect the revolution but to annihilate the threat of fascism that resides on our borders and liberate the working people of Europe. A truly revolutionary struggle will begin, as the strike against fascists and their militarist parasites expands and will set all countries ablaze. It was a unanimous vote in all chambers of the Volksrepublik, as Markus Wolf and Max Reimann authorized the military to begin their actions towards the Dutch border. First, exercises were seen, as the airforce and the land forces were working in collaboration, but soon, Heinz Kessler gave the order and authorized the operation to liberate the Netherlands from fascist occupation. After destroying all the initial defenses, instead of being met with resistance, the Volksarmee was met with cheers and applauses from the locals, as the SS and collaborators began their retreat inwards.

ddr_risen.1001.d: "News from Europe continues to make headlines as the new Communist regime in Germany moves troops into the Netherlands. This invasion follows a long series of purges of members of the old National Socialist regime as well as those sympathetic to its ideology. As such it is no surprise that the German People's Republic (DVR) has set its sights on overthrowing the National Socialist Dutch regime. \n\nIn addition, the DVR has announced that the goal of 'Operation Schaft' is to establish a new Dutch regime “consistent with the principles of worker’s liberation”. This dashed hopes of a return of the Surinamese Dutch Government in Exile to the mainland as well as hopes that the new German regime would be a friend of the OFN. It seems instead that New Germany wishes for hegemony by finishing off the Reichskomissariats."

ddr_risen.201.t: "Victorious Feast"
ddr_risen.201.d: "Far and wide as the eye can wander, heath and bog are everywhere. Not the sound of a weapon or the bushes shaking anymore, whilst the barbed wire cover the lands and the rifles are as ready as ever. According to all knowledgeable sources, to the Stasi and to the highest-ranking members of the Volkspolizei, on this raised bog, hidden in the thick fogs and amidst the countless plants remained a stronghold of national socialists. \n\nIt had been proven time and time again, the superiority of the revolutionary forces against the terrified dogs of reaction when various battles and investigations ended in the elimination of their leaders - Von Thadden, Andrae, Gehlen, Rudel, and the monster Stangl. Yet, burying all of them did not completely end the movement, as the leftovers rallied in a pitiful escape from the encroaching forces of the Volkspolizei, the Stasi, and an accompanying Volksarmee armored division. \n\nLooking through the binoculars, the Minister of Security, Erich Mielke, the entire head of the operation, would note the difficulty of getting the armored vehicles and tanks through the swamp. His approach consisted of tolerating no failures, providing supply, and punishing corruption. Leading the armored division and coordinating with the Volkspolizei officers, General Sigfrid Reidel would continue the work of improving the morale in this ending offensive.The tanks would instead, encircle the entire area, not trying to approach the difficult terrain and prevent the Nazis from doing their usual escapades. While the officers would burst in after the fort was bombarded. Precisely, as the groups of officers began their raid after the bombardment of the fort, the resistance they were met with lacked numbers, as most of the remaining Werwolves attempted to flee. \n\nYet, they were unaware of the preparations by Sigfrid. They either surrendered or their bodies were spread across the moor, none fled. "Inside the cabin, Klopfer, he's the only one who knows where Remer is, I swear!" From one's pleas, the said cabin was broken into. The soldiers announced, the Werwolf went extinct: Gerhard Klopfer took his own life. "
ddr_risen.201.a: "A fitting end for a coward."

ddr_risen.202.t: "In Sheep's Skin"
ddr_risen.202.d: "Otto Remer stared out over the swamp he’d fled to ever since the Reich’s fall. Behind him, his forces were razing the house that he’d been hiding out in as leader of the Werewolves. The captured members of the Volkspolizei who’d tried to hunt him down were also in there. Turning behind him he stared at the men who were loyal to the Reich above all, loyal to the ideals that had made Germany great. They stood tall and proud their string of victories against the Volkspolizei had been enough to reassure them that National Socialism would return one day. \n\nThe Bolsheviks and their Jewish puppet masters had thought that the men of the Reich would be defeated with ease. They had been wrong. The Reich had fallen not because of the weakness of the great Aryan men but the weakness of the liberals and traitors that had taken over following the death of the Führer. Tresckow, Speer, and Oberländer were all fools and traitors to the Reich and the Volk. A new struggle was needed, and Otto Remer would lead it. \n\nTurning to his men he began to speak. \n\n“Soldiers. The struggle for Germany is not yet over, our fight is not over. The Reich will be reforged, and the traitors, Bolsheviks, Jews, and liberals that brought down the greatest work of the Aryan Volk will be punished. The Reich will rise again. But for now, we must hide. We must gather our forces. This new Volksrepublik is weak. We will emerge triumphant soon. For now, though? Now we hide, we gather the might of National Socialism, and we intensify the flame until it scours Bolshevism, from Germany.” \n\nThe cheer that followed was music to his ears as he took off the cap that he had worn ever since the Reich’s greatest triumph and threw it into the raging fire. The Communists would fall. The Reich would return. It was all just a matter of time. "
