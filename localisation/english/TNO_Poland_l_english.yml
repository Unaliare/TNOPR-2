 #Leader Descriptions#
 POL_Emil_Fieldorf:0 "Emil Fieldorf"
 POLITICS_EMIL_FIELDORF_DESC:0 "In 1939, Poland's three decade long nightmare began. Invaded and subjugated by the Reich, the Polish people were subject to cruelty and barbarity known only to those the Nazis viewed as subhuman. Though the Polish state on the map was wiped out, the Polish nation lived on in the forests, hills, and sewers. Partisan warfare never ended, the Polish resistance never gave up, and neither did Emil Fieldorf.\n\nFieldorf assumed command of the Home Army following the horrors of the Warsaw Uprising. A life-long patriot and veteran of both World Wars, Fieldorf is a warrior born, committed to the ideals of Polish independence and democracy. If the Polish state had survived the night of 1939, Fieldorf might have been a celebrated general, maybe even a president of the republic. As it is, he is now the ruler of an underground republic, a state in the shadows that Fieldorf hopes, prays, and begs the Almighty, might one day step into the light.\n\nThe agony of Poland has been terrible, and Fieldorf feels the death of every one of his fighters strongly, and for their part, his warriors see the old soldier as a father figure. Fieldorf knows that the Polish nation is an idea, an integral part of every Pole, and if even one of them lives, then Poland lives on with them. The night is long, the Reich seemingly unstoppable, but Fieldorf has never given up hope."
