 POLITICS_FAROUK_I_DESC:0 "King Farouk of Egypt is a man of many, many tastes. To frame him in a positive light, Farouk is determined to make life a party, that every moment should be one of fun and excitement in an effort to never to grow old or dull. To frame him negatively, he is a sinkhole for the Egyptian economy, totally removed from his political responsibilities and an embarrassment for Egypt. The King might have once been a young man, keen and enthusiastic about reforming and modernizing his country. Those days have passed however, and now Farouk wishes only to entertain himself in any way that he can.\n\nFarouk spends his days eating, drinking, and smoking during his quiet moments. In his unfortunately frequent wild moments he spends his time driving through the streets of Cairo at full speed in his red sports car or perhaps engaging in some charity by firing a shower of gold coins into a crowd. If the King finds himself in a particularly active mood, he may get in his jet and fly to whatever destination he desires. His absence in Egypt is joyfully felt, as it usually leaves someone more competent in charge for a week or two.\n\nOn his tours of the world, Farouk puts the Egyptian treasury to "great" use, spending it lavishly to obtain all the objects of his desires, whether that be a diamond necklace for his latest mistress, a set of coins for his ever-expanding collection, or perhaps a shot at immortality. Regardless of what he purchases, it is certainly never of any use to the people of Egypt. Farouk is not malicious or evil, but he is a man that cares little for the world outside of his immediate vicinity. Politics is a serious, drawn out, and often boring matter for the King, and as such he ignores it. He would rather be happy himself than stress about what the world wishes for him to do."

 #Events
#  egy.2.t:0 "The Situation of the Kingdom of Egypt"
#  egy.2.d:0 "Having expelled the British imperialists with the help of our loyal Italian allies, Egypt has finally achieved it's long awaited independence. Despite how great and glorious of a victory this was for all Egyptians, a nefarious cabal of disgruntled fascist-sympathizers attempted to overthrow our great king Farouk. This treasonous plot cumulated into the attempted 1956 "revolution", which was little more than a blind power grab by traitors within our armed forces.\n\nDespite some initial blunders on our part, and the temporary retreat from Cairo, help from our great Italian friends easily dispatched the remaining traitors. Of course, the Italians expected compensation, which was granted by our great king Farouk who personally allowed several Italian Advisers into our government.\n\nFarouk himself has celebrated our new found friendship with the Italians, and trusts them so much he's allowed them to begin governing in his absence. With this new found free time, Farouk has engaged in several important diplomatic trips, to such foreign places as Las Vegas, Havana, and Montecarlo."

 egy.6.t:0 "The Swiss Contact"
 egy.6.d:0 "Our king, Farouk, has been approached by leading Swiss banks for a very enticing deal. As his adventures have been hitting front page newspapers across the globe, the question of how exactly he finances this has come into question. It appears that the Swiss have figured out that he is siphoning from the government's wealth and using astute calculations have figured out that he will be running out soon enough.\n\nTherefore, they have approached Farouk with the offer of giving him extraordinarily large loans with a high interest rate to keep him going on his adventures across the globe, which Farouk has indicated he has intended to do. Leading economists of our government have strongly advised against this saying that it would crumble the already weak Egyptian economy, however Farouk has yet to reply to the government."
 egy.6.a:0 "What an obvious scam."

 egy.7.t:0 "The Swiss Loans"
 egy.7.d:0 "Shocked silence is the overwhelming noise in the palace halls and government offices today, as the reply that has been received from Farouk on the Swiss loans issue is that he is accepting all of the loans. The minister of the economy has been heard silently weeping in his office, and the government accountants still haven't come to the conclusion on how expensive this will be for the Kingdom. However, one thing is clear. It's going to cost more than Egypt can handle."

 egy.13.d:0 "While the Free Officers may have failed in their revolution, some of their ideas still live on in the Ba'athist movement. The Ba'athist party is officially banned by the Egyptian government but that has not stopped people from supporting the group. In Cairo, newsppapers are running a story on how a meeting of military men, bureaucrats and various low level politicians have met up in a Cairo flat to discuss the future of Egypt and how best to install the Ba'athist revolution. Some even reported that the last surviving leader of the Free Officers movement, Gamel Abdel Nasser was seen at these meetings!\n\nWhile the government dismisses these stories as sensationalist nonsense, many in the government are worried about the Ba'athists organising and launching a revolution against our regime."
 egy.13.a:0 "These Ba'athist gangs need to be put down!"
 
 egy.14.t:0 "Qutb speaks in Khartoum"
 egy.14.d:0 "The Sudan has always had some disconnect from the rest of Egypt, and has made prime breeding ground for anti-monarchist feeling. This is most obviously seen in the rise of Islamism there, mostly spearheaded by an Egyptian, Sayyid Qutb.\n\nJust today, he held a rally in Khartoum speaking of the Gunaah of the Egyptian regime and of Farouk himself. He also called for people to find their way back to the true light of Islam and not to remain the Takfirs that they have been led to become.\n\nBefore he could finish his speech, Egyptian policemen came into the square to break up the rally, much to the crowds anger."

 ##### Farouks Grand Tour Events #######
 egy.11.t:0 "The Flight to Iberia"
 egy.11.d:0 "Farouk has been called many things, but modest is certainly not one of them. His arrival to Spain aboard a commercial airliner, confiscated for his personal use, should be proof enough of his character. To the anguish of the Iberian welcoming party, the transportation prepared for Farouk proved to be inadequate to transport his numerous escorts and luggage in addition to himself.\n\nBut such logistical problems could not interest the king the tiniest bit. Here he was, in Iberia, a land that promised to provide a multitude of pleasures to indulge in!"
 egy.11.a:0 "The peninsula awaits! ¡Vamos!"
 
 egy.10.t:0 "The Deal of a Lifetime"
 egy.10.d:0 "Behind the facade formed by the busy main streets, Istanbul hides a thriving bazaar economy. Anything a man desires can be bought in these holes-in-walls, and vast amounts of money change hands daily. An especially infamous part of these markets are formed by historical artifacts, from antiquities around the world to memorabilia from the Second World War. Farouk's interest in all things expensive lead him to a certain shopkeeper, and soon he found himself in an auction for something dangerous.\n\nOnce the shopkeeper had determined that Farouk was indeed a man of great wealth, he invited the king to a secret auction happening in a shady warehouse. With the promise of items for sale that he would not want to miss, Farouk and his guards accepted the invitation. Upon arrival, Farouk joined a motley crew of a dozen others, among which two individuals stood out. The two large and imposing men, boasting a few scars on their faces, remained silent through most of the auction, as rare and expensive paintings, books and pottery was sold to the rest of the crowd. Farouk himself bought a few chandeliers, but the item advertised to him was the final piece on offer; A vial containing water from the Fountain of Youth."
 egy.10.a:0 "Intriguing..."

 egy.12.t:0 "The Auction of a Lifetime"
 egy.12.d:0 "The auctioneer explained that the vial allegedly containing water from a fountain of legends had been passed on for centuries to great men and women throughout history. Beginning from Alexander the Great, it was said to have graced the hands of such men as Charlemagne, Elizabeth I and Otto von Bismarck, and in the aftermath of the Great War, it had been lost, only to end up in this warehouse for sale today. While suspicious, Farouk could not afford to miss on this chance of a lifetime. It was now that the two odd men sprung into action.\n\nThe auction was intense, and the constant gasping of the audience was music to Farouk's ears as the price kept climbing. Soon, it was Farouk against the two men. In a final bid to secure victory, Farouk made an offer the two men simply could not match, and the day was won.\n\nWhile the price had been disgustingly high, Farouk received the vial. To the shock of everyone in the room, he drank the contents as soon as he got the vial in his hands. His two competitors lamented loudly in German, and prior to making their exit they remarked that the League would not forget such an insult. Farouk naturally didn't give another thought to the threat, after all, he was now immortal! Unless he had been lied to from the start, which his pride would not allow to even be a possibility."
 egy.12.a:0 "Tastes like victory!"
 
 egy.1.t:0 "Farouk's Peak"
 egy.1.d:0 "Farouk was having the time of his life. I mean, who wouldn't? A party in your name, with the most extravagant and lavish event with the richest and most famous people of the world attending. He might be very inebriated and at least a little high, but he could still think clearly enough to feel proud. He had travelled the world, seen the sights, met the good and the great, and had a hell of a good time doing it. These past 2 years, in Farouks eyes at least, were the best of the world.\n\nHowever, as he moved away from the buffet after gorging himself on food, he felt odd. It felt like something was stuck, and he had a hard time pinning down what was wrong. When he tried to speak, he quickly realised the issue. Something was stuck in his throat. He started trying to speak, trying to cough, anything to get people attention, trying to get the words out for help. Won't anyone notice, anyone come to help him? However, people were too busy talking amongst themselves, with the music drowning out his attempts at choking out a call for assistance. He collapsed to the ground, in his drunken state being unable to control his movements. His vision grew darker, the noises around him disappearing into the background. He made one last attempt at crying for help, trying to sputter out a final noise to try and get someone to come to his aid.\n\nBut nobody came.\n\nHis last thoughts were of his son, and how sorry he felt for him."
 egy.1.a:0 "It appears that the party is over."
