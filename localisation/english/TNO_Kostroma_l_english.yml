 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_SERGEI_BOLSHAKOV_DESC:0 "Sergei Petrovich Bolshakov lived a fairly uninteresting life before the Great Patriotic War, working as an accountant in the Vologda Oblast. But after being drafted into the Red Army, he quickly rose through the ranks and became the lieutenant of an anti-tank brigade. But when the tide of the war had thoroughly turned in Germany's favor, many in his unit deserted and he had to helplessly watch as his home became absorbed by the newly-formed Reichskommissariat Moskowien. He attached himself to the West Russian Revolutionary Front in the ensuing years - not out of any particular ideological loyalty, but out of the desire to see his homeland freed. He also became close friends with General Vasily Ivanov, a fellow native of Vologda, and soon became the General's close confidant.\n\nWhen the West Russian War ground to a halt and the Front's alliance began to disintegrate,  Ivanov and his force declared neutrality, seeking to protect the liberated civilians of Vologda from further bloodshed. On the periphery of his territories was the city of Kostroma, which was too far from his provisional capital to administer directly, but too important to leave to its own devices. Unsurprisingly, Bolshakov was the first man he tapped to act as governor.\n\nBolshakov soon became renowned in the city for not only his leadership during the West Russian War, but also turning the city as a waypoint for Russian refugees seeking to flee Moskowien. He was even to facilitate some limited trade between other city-states and Moskowien's industry - something that left a bitter taste in many people's mouths, but few complained about the stability and prosperity it bought. The people of Kostroma were even grateful enough that they even held an election to officially declare him their Mayor. Although Bolshakov has been able to keep Kostroma in a delicate balance thus far, circumstances beyond his control may soon upset it..."

 ### Ideas ###
 KST_free_city:0 "Free City"
 KST_free_city_desc:0 "Under the protection of the Vologdans we have become one of the few hubs of prosperity in the desolate ruins of Russia. Not having to worry about our defence and focusing on trade allowed us to reach surprising heights, and we are one of the few places where Moskowien and the Russian statelets can truly meet. However, should Vologda fall, we will be next, so it is in our interest to help them as much as possible."

 ### Events ###
 KST.1.t:0 "The Vologdan Offer"
 KST.1.desc:0 "An important diplomatic message from our allies in Vologda has reached Kostroma's foreign office today. They make an offer that would seem brazen on the surface, but upon closer examination may be more generous than it appears. Vologda wishes for the city of Kostroma to join the many cities of their neutral zone as an equal partner. Should we accept, our days as an independent city will officially come to an end, but our autonomy and influence will be guaranteed within the neutral zone.\n\nHow do we respond?"
 KST.1.a:0 "Let us join forces with Vologda."
 KST.1.b:0 "Absolutely not!"
