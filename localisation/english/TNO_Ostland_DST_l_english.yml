 ### IDEAS ###
 DST_OST_focus:0 "Dethrone the Pretender"
 DST_OST_focus_desc:0 "Stahlecker comfortably sits upon his Rigan throne, unrightfully swept from Drechsler. Such a usurper grows only more legitimate, and thus only more dangerous, for each day he continues to draw breath. As such, all efforts are focused upon crushing Stahlecker and his merry band of traitors. The rest of the circus can wait."
 DST_BLR_focus:0 "Crush the Traitors"
 DST_BLR_focus_desc:0 "Vituska and his separatists plague our easternmost extremities, terrorizing us from the border of Moskowien, and if they have their way, all the way to Riga. A strong message will be sent that separatists will not be suffered. We shall put down the Belarussian uprising at once and make sure the traitor Vituska hangs."
 DST_MST_focus:0 "Silence the Liberals"
 DST_MST_focus_desc:0 "Andreas Meyer-Landrut and his ramshackle uprising of liberals and students ravage the cities of central Ostland. If we are to ever have peace of mind again, an example must be made of such ne'er-do-wells. We shall ensure that the liberal riff raff never again finds the will to cause disorder in our streets again."
 DST_JST_focus:0 "Burn the Fanatics"
 DST_JST_focus_desc:0 "The fanatics of the SchutzStaffel will stop at nothing to tear apart the fabric of the Reichskommissariat. Not even defeat will silence those radicals. We may only rely upon complete and total destruction to quell this treason. If we must salt the earth to ensure that these men never again crawl from the shadows, so be it."
 DST_UPO_focus:0 "Contain the Partisans"
 DST_UPO_focus_desc:0 "The only measure effective in bringing an end to the indiscriminate murder of Germans throughout Ostland at the hands of partisans is unrelenting force. With all fire focused upon Kovner and his partisans, we shall surely triumph in due time, and once again bring safety and security to the Germans settled throughout Ostland."
 DST_last_push:0 "The Final Push"
 DST_last_push_desc:0 ""
 
 ### NATIONAL FOCUS ###
 DST_the_rightful_heir:0 "The Rightful Heir"
 DST_the_rightful_heir_desc:0 "Lohse is dead, but there is no time for Ostland to mourn. Threats have arisen in every direction, from rivals for Lohse's legacy to Belarusian peasant uprisings to men from the woods hell bent on revenge. Whilst the others who claim the title of Reichskommissar are either limp-wristed pencil pushers or SS dogs under the pay of Burgundy, only Drechsler has the steel to put down these rebels and restore Ostland to its place as the vigilant border guard of the Reich."
 DST_appeal_to_the_berserkers:0 "Release the Berserkers"
 DST_appeal_to_the_berserkers_desc:0 "Like the Norsemen of old, Germans have spread their culture across Europe with fire and sword. The Wiking blood still flows through our veins, and it is in defending our homeland that we will release its strength. They struck fear into the hearts of our enemies with their furious berserkers, and we shall raise a division to hold that berserker spirit in their hearts. Whilst our enemies are either ill-trained peasants or lions led by sheep, our shield-biters will always prevail."
 DST_a_gun_under_every_blade_of_grass:0 "A Gun Under Every Blade of Grass"
 DST_a_gun_under_every_blade_of_grass_desc:0 "Not one step of soil can be lost in this battle for Ostland's existence. Every town occupied by the partisans provides more peasants to join their cause, every step back from the traitor forces an unconscionable humiliation. Every German must be armed, for this is their fight - and those few natives we can trust as well. With a rifle behind every tree, a mine under every road, our enemies will fear to tread on our soil."
 DST_penal_latvian_divisions:0 "Penal Latvian Divisions"
 DST_penal_latvian_divisions_desc:0 "The Balts occupy a peculiar position in the racial hierarchy, neither pure like the Aryans nor unworthy of life like the Slavs. This has served them well enough that the labour camps are filled with Latvian criminals and dissidents, diligently working for the benefit of the Reich, being spared to work another day. Whilst no doubt they are filled with pride at serving their superiors, the battlefield calls for them.\n\nThe front lines always need bodies, and while Balts may not display Aryan strength and discipline, a body is a body. Put a rifle in their hands and point them towards the enemy, and they will keep shooting so long as they feel the whip on their backs."
 DST_conscript_lithuanian_germans:0 "Conscript the Lithuanian Germans"
 DST_conscript_lithuanian_germans_desc:0 "The Germans in Litauen are lucky enough to be far from the front lines, the native Lithuanians mostly resigned to their subservient position. We cannot allow this to suppress the German fighting spirit however, for this is a war for the whole Volk. Even if they must be dragged from their farms, put a gun in their hands and send them to the frontlines and they will soon overcome their passive tendencies."
 DST_stahlecker_goes_first:0 "Stahlecker Goes First"
 DST_stahlecker_goes_first_desc:0 "Final victory remains impossible when the German population of Ostland is divided amongst itself, and the instigator of this division is the pretender Franz Walter Stahlecker. So long as he claims the title of Reichskommissar, German will fight German, all while the men from the woods wreak bloody havoc on the sidelines.\n\nStahlecker's death is the only solution. A concerted push to break his front lines and storm his headquarters will be all we need to assert our rightful control of Ostland."
 DST_a_message_to_the_world:0 "A Message to the World"
 DST_a_message_to_the_world_desc:0 "Riga has ever been the centre of German civilisation in the Baltic, and has continued that legacy as the administrative centre of Ostland. Whilst in the hands of Stahlecker it was a symbol of the chaos that reigns Ostland - now that it has finally been retaken, it is a message that the time of chaos is over.\n\nThe Reichskommissar is intent on showing this to the world - all the Reich will know there is only one authority in the east."
 DST_against_the_traitor:0 "Against the Traitor"
 DST_against_the_traitor_desc:0 "Michal Vituska has long outlived his usefulness. While he performed a vital role in maintaining tolerable relations between the natives and German colonists, he has apparently used this same role to build up his underground movement of White Russians. Now that the chaos of civil war is upon us, his fighters have made their bid for regional dominance.\n\nIf Vituska is permitted to remove White Russia from Ostland, countless German settlers will find themselves under a vengeful partisan state and cut off from the protection of their Fatherland. Vituska and his army must be destroyed."
 DST_the_question_of_the_waffen:0 "The Question of the Waffen-SS"
 DST_the_question_of_the_waffen_desc: "Vituska built his power base while conducting the Reich's work with his Black Cats, his own all-Belarusian Waffen-SS unit. Now he is one of the most dangerous men in Ostland, and virtually every Belarusian division once loyal to the Reich has now defected to his cause. Defections have been reported from smaller Baltic units too, not only to the White Russian movement but to Abba Kovner's own United Partisan Organisation.\n\nLithuanians, Latvians and Estonians are considered by most of the German population to now be of questionable loyalty, and many worry about constantly having to look over their shoulders for comrades who may stab them in the back when the time is ripe. A decision must be made about the native Waffen-SS. This fear cannot stand."
 DST_target_the_students:0 "Target the Students"
 DST_target_the_students_desc:0 "Andreas Meyer-Landrut has been nought but a nuisance since he returned to Ostland. His stint in Poland evidently gave him some degenerate ideas, and he has spent his hoarded wealth and copious spare time spreading these ideas to the good youth of Ostland. Foolish ideas like democracy and equality have caused them to take up arms for the demagogue, while he lines his pockets with looted wealth. We must be cruel to be kind, and cut out the infection before it spreads to the rest of our misguided children."
 DST_lock_down_the_cities:0 "Lock Down the Cities"
 DST_lock_down_the_cities_desc:0 "While Wilna and Minsk are ours once more, the students simply will not shut up. Despite confiscating their arms for our own use, Meyer-Landrut's ideals remain in their minds. They have proven innovative in their methods, laying improvised explosives and blocking roads to hinder our forces. Many even continue to take to the streets to protest against their own liberation. This can continue no longer.\n\nIt will take many men, but we cannot tolerate insubordination. The cities will remain closed until further notice. We will see how long until the liberals stop complaining and start begging."
 DST_end_the_SS:0 "Bring an End to the SS"
 DST_end_the_SS_desc:0 "The SS have been a third column undermining the Reich for too long. While most of Himmler's fanatics have been confined to Burgundy there always remained those members who seemed to have earned "Faithful Heinrich"'s displeasure, stalking throughout Germany and no doubt reporting on our every move. Now their true loyalties have been confirmed.\n\nIf Himmler's zealots take Ostland they will subject it to unspeakable horrors, not to mention executing everyone in our government in a suitably horrific manner . These weeds must be dug out and destroyed, before they wreak irreversible havoc with their Burgundian ethics. It shouldn't be too hard to follow the trail of bodies."
 DST_scorched_earth:0 "Scorch the Earth"
 DST_scorched_earth_desc:0 "No longer does SS-black stain the map, but Himmler's dogs continue to roam the countryside. They refuse to see the hopelessness of their cause, and slowly but surely they draw their plans against us. They refuse to acknowledge their reality, and in their home of Dünaburg where the heart of their corruption lies is a den of criminality, iniquity and sabotage.\n\nWell, so be it. If they do not want to surrender we are under no obligation to be generous. A bullet for everyone aiding the Black Sun will solve our terrorist problem, and provide for us some much-needed peace of mind. Lettgallen will burn before the dubious SchutzStaffel are permitted to plot freely again."
 DST_strangle_the_partisans:0 "Strangle the Partisans"
 DST_strangle_the_partisans_desc:0 "For twenty years, a monster has lurked in the deep woods of Byelorussia. Every few years, some brave hunter and his party set out into the forest to hunt this most dangerous game, only to quickly find they themselves were the hunted. Those few who ever escaped claimed to have slain the beast, presenting trophies to prove their valour, but mere weeks later more corpses would be found to disillusion them of this fact. The men from the woods go where they please; do what they please; kill whom they please.\n\nAbba Kovner is not dead, and many insist he cannot be killed. This reputation is what has made him the most feared man in Ostland, and his organisation has the blood of thousands of Germans on its hands. Generalplan Ost is incomplete, and Kovner is living proof. Time to finish the job."
 DST_expand_the_camps:0 "Expand the Labor Camps"
 DST_expand_the_camps_desc:0 "The United Partisan Organisation is shattered, its members either scattered to the four winds, stagnating in a cell or mouldering in the grave. Finally the greatest threat to German dominance in Ostland has been eliminated, and the gentle hand of government can be placed over the peasants once more.\n\nNaturally the partisans cannot be allowed to continue to spread their subversive ideas to the rest of the natives, so for their own good they must be confined and put to work. Any metropolitan German would be welcome for the job security to be found in Maly Trostenets - how many can boast they held the same job their whole life?"
 DST_the_final_push_against_degeneracy:0 "The Final Push Against Degeneracy"
 DST_the_final_push_against_degeneracy_desc:0 "Victory is but a hair's breadth away - separatists, partisans and traitors flee before the strength of the Reichskommissariat, and in most of Ostland's towns resistance is a dirty word. Like a stain, however, resistance clings on, fighting our attempts to assert control with an almost pitiful futility. One push will be all that is required before the whole rotten structure comes crashing down."
 DST_looking_to_the_colonies:0 "Looking to the Colonies"
 DST_looking_to_the_colonies_desc:0 "Peace has been restored. Abba Kovner finally fertilises the dirt of the land he defended, Michal Vituska's treachery has been repaid twelve times over, and every would-be Reichskommissar has been disposed of with great prejudice. Now Ostland can return to its position as the Reich's model colony. A peaceful land, a quiet people. This has always been Drechsler's goal, despite the brutal methods he has been forced into taking to achieve it.\n\nCome and see."
 
 #EVENTS
 DST.4.t:0 "Trouble in Ostland"
 DST.4.d:0 "Lukas was reading a novel when his commanding officer suddenly ran in from the rain. "Help me close the garage doors. Quickly!" Lukas had heard that tone of voice before. He was in a commanding and anxious mood. Just follow the orders. Lukas put down his novel and rushed over to the chains and lowered them as fast as he could. Soon, all the garage doors were closed. His superior headed straight towards the armory.\n\n"Sir, what are you doing?" asked Lukas. Offizier Schmidt was typically a very prepared man, but even this seemed out of the ordinary. He came out with a rifle and a few clips for Lukas, and a submachine gun for himself.\n\n"Preparing for the worst. Haven't you heard?" the offizier asked. "There's a damn coup going on, Lukas. Turncoats in our own Ostland forces, the goddamn Wehrmacht. I've even heard of some blackshirt-looking guys turning up. Didn't look like they were from Germany. It's a complicated situation."\n\n"What do we do?" asked Lukas. He opened up the bolt of the rifle hoping to load in the stripper clips and a cartridge flew out. Schmidt shook his head in disappointment. The gun was already loaded.\n\n"We sit tight. We get our radio and see what our orders are. Drechsler screwed up, couldn't keep the place stable. But we're loyal," said Schmidt, as he looked towards Lukas. "Right?"\n\n"Yes sir," answered Lukas. Suddenly there was a banging on one of the garage doors."
 DST.4.a:0 ""Who goes there? Identify yourself!""

 DST.5.t:0 "Demanding New Territories from Moskowien"
 DST.5.d:0 "Hans Gewecke was the aide to the Otto-Heinrich Drechsler. He looked like a professor with his dark rimmed glasses - not someone who had personally shot undesirables. For the day, Gewecke had drafted the new demands for the Reich. Drechsler wished to take over control of Luka, Pleskau, and Nebel from Moskowien. Ostland's Wehrmacht would preside over the territories and crush any remaining partisans. Gewecke entered Drechsler's office and placed the demands onto his desk for a final look through before sending it off to Göring. Drechsler took the memo and read through it, grunted an affirmation, and added: "Perhaps we should have asked for more." Gewecke just sighed and took back the memo as he left the office to the sound of hoarse laughter."
 DST.5.a:0 "Göring had better accept."

 DST.6.t:0 "Göring Accepts the Demands"
 DST.6.d:0 "Gewecke didn't find Drechsler at the office. The secretary told him he was out celebrating at a place with more women and more champagne. Gewecke was not at all amused with that answer. He muttered to himself all the way up to the car and told his driver to floor it. The damn fool didn't even know that there were already administrative changes to make. His "eminence" even had the gall to ask for more territory. It was one obstacle after the next going through the rings of guards and having to show his identification to the whole motley crew of incompetent thugs. When he got there, Drechsler was just having a grand old time with his friends, the lot of them loud, red-faced, and absolutely unbearable. Gewecke didn't care about proper manners anymore as he walked straight up to Drechsler with the response from Göring in hand. "Sir, we've got the territories and we-" Gewecke said.\n\n"Of course we did," Drechsler said, champagne glass in his other hand. "Why else are we celebrating?" The room burst into laughter.\n\n"We need to start reintegrating those lands," Gewecke explained in front of all the drunken guests. "We need troops in there and Ostland needs your permission to do it."\n\n"Oh come on, Gewecke. Relax a little. That can all wait until tomorrow!" Drechsler slurred. "We have more than enough time to plunder and control those new territories."\n\nGewecke just shook his head, turned around and left. He could hear the murmurs behind him and Drechsler trying to goad them back into having fun. Gewecke wondered why he even bothered sometimes."
 DST.6.a:0 "Might as well."

 DST.7.t:0 "A Surprise Inspection from Schörner"
 DST.7.d:0 "Gewecke and Drechsler were in the car beside a series of Wehrmacht barracks. Normally, they wouldn't have bothered with troop inspections save for posterity's sake. Today was different. Göring had rejected the demands for Moskowien's territory and, just incidentally, Schörner decided for a surprise inspection of Wehrmacht forces in Ostland. Judging from Drechsler's quaking knees and sweaty brow, it was an intimidation tactic and it was working. They did not call him Bloody Ferdinand for nothing. "Damn it, Gewecke. We never should have asked in the first place. If it wasn't for you drafting out the demands-"\n\n"Me, drafting out the demands?" Gewecke asked, incredulously. "You were practically drooling for those new territories."\n\nDrechsler shook his head, refusing to continue the conversation. He went back to staring out the window. Just waiting for Schörner to finish the inspection so they could talk it through with him and hope that everything went well. Drechsler thought he and Schörner were on decent terms before in the past. The suspense seemed nearly unbearable until Schörner could be seen leaving the building. Drechsler immediately opened the door to the car and approached Schörner for a handshake."
 DST.7.a:0 "Let us hope this goes well."

 DST.8.t:0 "Göring Wants to Renegotiate"
 DST.8.d:0 ""Sir, they want to renegotiate," said Gewecke. "I just got the response today from Germania."\n\nDreschler heard that and looked around. "But why? Why renegotiate a dead deal? What was that whole deal with Schörner coming into Ostland?"\n\nGewecke shook his head. "I don't know sir. Göring just said he wanted to renegotiate and didn't say anything more. Perhaps it was some sort of psychological trick."\n\n"Damned if I know," Dreschler said. "So long as I don't see Bloody Ferdinand again. Send him the old demands and see where we go from there. Let us not push our luck too much but keep me in the know if anything new springs up."\n\n"Yes sir," Gewecke responded. Dreschler sounded uncharacteristically leader-like for a moment, Gewecke thought. Was it from fear or did even his arrogance have limits?"
 DST.8.a:0 "One way or another, there was work to be done."

 DST.9.t:0 "Göring Accepts the New Demands"
 DST.9.d:0 "Gewecke was heading to Drechsler's office to tell him the news that Göring had accepted their demands. When he opened the door, Drechsler was looking outside the window. Very uncharacteristic of the man. "Sir, they have accepted our demands," said Gewecke.\n\n"All of these complications - only to give in at the end. What is going on in Germania?" Drechsler wondered.\n\n"It all seems complicated sir," Gewecke answered. "But beyond our intelligence capabilities. We are merely a colony state after all."\n\n"That may be so," Drechsler said as he turned around. "But now that we have these territories, we shall show the Reich and the world our strength in being the envy of the other Reichskommissariats. But tonight, however..." Drechsler opened up a drawer to pull out a bottle of champagne. "Tonight we celebrate."\n\nHans Gewecke shrugged. Might as well."
 DST.9.a:0 "To prosperity and strength!"

 DST.10.t:0 "Göring Rejects the Deal"
 DST.10.d:0 ""Bad news sir, Göring is threatening to cut off trade and he's arranging for Schörner on another inspection."\n\n"What?" said Drechsler. "Schörner's visiting again? What for? I thought our men had their boots polished and fatigues tucked in the first damn time."\n\n"SIr, it seems that Göring doesn't like our new demands. He hinted that all of this would be swept under the carpet if only we just take back our demands."\n\nDrechsler slammed the table. "That obstinate fat fuck! Tell him that we do not negotiate under threat and we put forth our demands again."\n\nGewecke shook his head. "Sir, this is the Reich that we're trying to strongarm. They're going to send Schörner again and I have a feeling he won't be as polite. Our trade with the Reich is one of our last economic lifelines. Our economy has been devastated from the Ostland Civil War. I strongly urge you to reconsider."\n\nDrechsler grunted at his desk. He had to make a decision - one which may affect whether he stays on as the undisputed master of Ostland."
 DST.10.a:0 ""Stay the course! Show no weakness.""
 DST.10.b:0 ""Alright, we'll reconsider. Call off the demands.""

 DST.11.t:0 "A Wave of Partisan Violence"
 DST.11.d:0 "Friedrich-Wilhelm Müller had one of the toughest jobs in Ostland. He was the chief Security Minister for rounding up partisans, dissidents, and other annoying threats to the stability of the colony. Today, he had some bad news for Drechsler: there has been a string of partisan activity and they've killed a few Germans. A shooting here, a bombing there, it didn't seem like wanton violence but it was too early for Müller to say there was an organized conspiracy at work. He guessed that the meeting with Drechsler was going to be rough and he was right.\n\n"What do you mean that they were hitting Germans? Do you know how bad this looks if the Reich found out?" Drechsler asked. He was practically fuming.\n\n"I do know sir but I can't make any drastic moves now. There are too many unknowns at play," Müller responded. "For all we know, this is just a sign that our anti-partisan forces are working and-"\n\n"You call this working? Dead Germans is working?" Drechsler shouted. He was standing up now. "I'm going to tell you how to solve this: smoke the rats out. I want hostages taken, I want all our intelligence working around the clock, I want these partisans found! No more excuses."\n\n"If I may," Müller began, "let us give it some time. Maybe they have committed all their resources and intelligence and it's only burning through the rest of their assets. For all we know, in even just a few weeks, this would all go away."\n\nDrechsler sat down again. Maybe Müller was right. Or maybe he was just a coward."
 DST.11.a:0 ""No, find the partisans and kill them. Now.""
 DST.11.b:0 ""Wait it out but keep a close eye on the situation.""

 DST.12.t:0 "Crackdown Failure"
 DST.12.d:0 "Drechsler pinched the bridge of his nose and groaned. The documents laid out before him staring back mockingly. He took a large swig of coffee and continued reading, his teeth grinding together in frustration.\n\nThe reports had grown even more dire. His attempt to crack down on partisan activity through violence and intimidation was backfiring drastically, and the rebels were beginning to push back against him more viciously than ever. Kidnapping families was fueling their hatred. Placing towns under martial law was strengthening their resolve. Mass executions of suspected terrorists had only served to drive more people into the clutches of the partisans.\n\nDrechsler stared at the black coffee swirling in his mug. He needed something stronger."
 DST.12.a:0 "Much stronger."

 DST.13.t:0 "Rebellions Break Out"
 DST.13.d:0 "Several rebellions have broken out throughout the regions, some of which have almost been powerful to provide a genuine threat to our forces. Our policy of waiting for partisan terror attacks and murders to subside has completely backfired, serving to only embolden these thugs. If we continue to stand by and do nothing, we could witness another horrific civil war breaking out in Ostland.\n\nAs much as it pains us, we must beg Göring for help before this escalates any further."
 DST.13.a:0 ""Get me on the line with the Führer!""

 DST.14.t:0 "Aid from the Führer"
 DST.14.d:0 "The Reich has come to our rescue.\n\nDespite our difficult relationship with Germania, the Führer himself has agreed to our requests after Drechslers's (admittedly humiliating) phone conversation. The Reich will send aid to help us fight back against the partisan scum who are waging open rebellion throughout the region. The weapons and supplies will bolster our attempts to suppress the rebellions, while publicly announcing Göring's support will both boost our men's morale and crush the confidence of the partisans.\n\nWith the tide turning, triumph shall come swiftly."
 DST.14.a:0 "We bow before the Führer's magnanimity."

 DST.15.t:0 "Crackdown Triumph"
 DST.15.d:0 "After much struggle, the open rebellions raging within the borders of Ostland have at last been crushed, thanks to the bravery of our troops and the military wisdom of Drechsler. Our crackdown has been harsh, our reprisals brutal, and the scope of our suppression widespread. Those captured will be publicly executed throughout the region as a warning to any who dare resist the administration. The combination of our merciless abolition of dissent with the partisans' aptitude for collateral damage has likely quelled any remaining spark of defiance nestling in the bosoms of our native subjects. After a short period of martial law, when we are certain that order and stability has been re-established, we shall return to normal."
 DST.15.a:0 "Things should calm down now."

 DST.16.t:0 "Another Refusal"
 DST.16.d:0 ""Why doesn't he answer my calls?" Drechsler snapped, pacing the room furiously. "Why does he have reply to my demands through my fucking foreign ministry?!"\n\n"He's the Führer," Hans Gewecke shrugged, rubbing his-dark rimmed eyes. "He must be a busy man."\n\n"I know he's the Führer you oaf!" Drechsler roared, slamming the table with his fist. The Foreign Minister jumped. "He's disrespecting my authority! He's kicking me aside like I'm an annoying little dog!" He slumped back into his chair and ground his teeth. His Foreign Minister waited awkwardly as the Reichskommissar tried to control his breathing. "What did Göring say?"\n\n"He, uh..." Gewecke cleared his throat. "The Führer has denied our territorial requests. Again."\n\n"He has? Interesting." Drechsler grabbed his empty coffee mug intensely, his knuckles turning white. He was staring into space with unblinking eyes. "Please leave."\n\nGewecke nodded respectfully and darted from the room, closing the door just in time to hear the mug shattering into pieces."
 DST.16.a:0 "He took the news better than expected."
 
 DST.17.t:0 "The Reply"
 DST.17.d:0 ""Why doesn't he answer my calls?" Drechsler snapped, pacing the room furiously. "Why does he have reply to my demands through my fucking foreign ministry?!"\n\n"He's the Führer," Hans Gewecke shrugged. "He must be a busy man."\n\n"I know he's the Führer you oaf!" Drechsler roared, slamming the table with his fist. The Foreign Minister jumped. "He's disrespecting my authority! He's kicking me aside like I'm an annoying little dog!" He slumped back into his chair and ground his teeth. His Foreign Minister waited awkwardly as the Reichskommissar tried to control his breathing. "What did Göring say?"\n\n"The Führer has approved our territorial requests," Gewecke replied. Drechsler looked up in surprise. "We will soon control land leading all the way up to the great city of Brauchitschtadt in Moskowien."\n\n"Excellent!" Drechsler rubbed his hands together joyfully. He would show the rulers of Moskowien how to deal with partisans, and then... who knows where his rise to power would lead him?"
 DST.17.a:0 "The Führer's wisdom shines through."
 
 DST.18.t:0 "Aid from the Reichsmarschall"
 DST.18.d:0 "Despite Göring's inaction, the Reich has come to our rescue.\n\nReichsmarschall Ferdinand Schörner has violently crushed the rebellions breaking out within our borders, suppressing the partisan scum with brutally effective methods ranging from cunning anti-guerrilla strategy to mass reprisals.\n\nThe Chief of the OKW has not yet asked for anything in return for saving our region from impending collapse, but nonetheless we owe him greatly..."
 DST.18.a:0 "The man has more guts than the Führer."

 DST.19.t:0 "The Führer's Demands"
 DST.19.d:0 ""Reichskommissar!" Lukas cried as he burst into the room. "The Führer himself is on the line! I'll put him through to you immediately."\n\n"What?" Drechsler looked up from his paperwork with wide eyes. Hermann Göring was phoning him? The Führer himself was phoning Drechsler? "Yes, yes, put him through." He plucked up the phone and waited eagerly for the click.\n\n"Reichskommissar Drechsler!" came the tired but cheerful voice. "A pleasure to speak with you. I have some fantastic proposals for Ostland's garrison."\n\nAs the call continued, Drechsler's grin slowly faded away. Göring spoke with great enthusiasm as he described enforcing military modernizations of the garrison, modernizations that sounded both costly and tiresome. His weak attempts at rebuttals were swiftly waved away by the charismatic Führer. Drechsler's grip on the phone was tightening in anger. This is why he had called?"
 DST.19.a:0 "We can't refuse, but we can certainly drag our feet."

 DST.20.t:0 "The Waffen-SS Question"
 DST.20.d:0 "As the horrors of the Ostland Civil War exploded with the region's continued collapse, betrayal was widespread. The non-German divisions of the Waffen-SS turned tail and fled to the slimy Vituska, who embraced their strength and resources with open arms. The question remains how best to deal with these untermenschen traitors. There is no questioning their value as skilful and experienced soldiers, but can we risk treason against the Reich breaking out among their ranks yet again?"
 DST.20.a:0 "Their expertise is necessary for Ostland's stability. Let them serve us."
 DST.20.b:0 "We shall never work with subhuman traitors. Purge them all!"

 DST.21.t:0 "Waffen-SS Loyalty"
 DST.21.d:0 "In his wisdom, Reichskommissar Drechsler has seen fit to pardon the Waffen-SS who served under Vituska and allow them back into our ranks. These men are many things - ruthless, hardened, skilled. One thing they are not, however, is stupid. These Untermensch know that their lives are at stake and are more than willing to continue serving us. Afterall, they know what will befall them if they dare turn against us yet again."
 DST.21.a:0 "Like any man, they fear the bullet."

 ### OTHER SHITE (TOOLTIPS AND THE LIKE) ###
