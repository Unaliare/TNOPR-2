 NPL_Marian_Spychalski: "Marian Spychalski"
 POLITICS_MARIAN_SPYCHALSKI_DESC: "An architect in his youth, Marian Spychalski dedicated his life to the cause of the liberation of the Polish working people. Being a member of the Polish Communist Party, Spychalski became involved in the leftist Polish underground since the very first days of the Nazi occupation, forming a partisan group called Gwardia Ludowa. Seeking to establish friendly relationships with the Soviet brothers, Spychalski accommodated the Red Army forces when the West Russian War waged on the eastern frontier of the Reich's conquests, hoping that Poles and Russians together will liberate Poland and other oppressed nations of Europe from the fascist yoke.\n\nBut the Front, disadvantaged by its own internal struggles between commanders, could not bring liberation to his people. Along with his comrades, Spychalski found himself at the service of the Polish ASSR in Western Kazakhstan, which became a refuge for both the Soviet Poles who found hostility in the ravaged Russian land and the exiled Poles who were driven out from their homes by the Nazi invaders. Owing to his fame as a partisan leader, Spychalski quickly became one of the most prominent members of the reformed Polish military. On behalf of the Polish generals, who believed the government headed by the Polish Workers' Party was too dogmatic and short-sighted to deal with the pressing issues in the ASSR, Spychalski orchestrated a bloodless coup against the party leadership, emerging as the chairman of the Rada Ocalenia Nowej Polski.\n\nInaugurating as a military dictator in times of crisis, Spychalski avowed to preserve the state of Nowa Polska and protect it from the power-hungry Kazakh warlords that threaten its existence. Although he still sincerely pledges his allegiance to the socialist cause and Soviet Union, he isn't ashamed to neglect the revolutionary principles in favor of pragmatic decisions and seek inconvenient allies among class enemies - whatever it takes for the new Polish homeland to survive in the unforgiving, war-ridden land of Central Asia."

 NPL_Spychalski_Bizarre_Dictatorship_idea: "Marian Spychalski's Bizarre Dictatorship"
 NPL_Spychalski_Bizarre_Dictatorship_idea_desc: "The "Rada Ocalenia Nowej Polski" (RONP) assumed power through a bloodless coup against the ineffective civilian government led by the Polish Workers' Party. The new military dictatorship consists of officers that fought alongside the Soviet Union in either the 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division or leftist resistance movements such as the People's Guard or the People's Army. Its political ideology defies categorization - Marian Spychalski declares "full allegiance to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the Soviet Union and socialism as a whole", all while making tactical alliances with the clergy, subverting the Polish Workers' Party, and liberalizing society as a whole. This has been viewed as a betrayal of the principles of socialism by some, and has thus lead to staunch critique by ideological purists of the Polish Workers' Party. In the end, the RONP exists solely to ensure the survival of the endangered Polish nation - everything else comes second."

 NPL.5.t: "Not Yet Lost"
 NPL.5.desc: "By decree of the RONP, today is the day our people celebrate their independence from three empires of old. The choice remains controversial among the cadres of the Polish Workers' Party, due to their leadership's vehement insistence that the Second Republic was a failure - an authoritarian, capitalist aberration - soon to be crushed under the tank treads of the German.\n\nDespite every effort on the part of the Polish Workers' Party, Nowa Polska never quite was a bastion of pure communism. For many figures, such as Spychalski, the communist legacy of Nowa Polska no longer holds much meaning. This view is shared by the vast majority of our people, who braved hell and high water, travelling thousands of kilometers from the former lands of the Second Republic and the Soviet Union, merely for a chance to live. To speak their tongue. To practice their faith.\n\nAs such, despite a few naysayers, the return to the celebration of the 11th of November as Independence Day has been largely viewed as a natural correction. While few among us saw those momentous events decades ago, now is the time to remember. To remember that back then, in 1918, through the sacrifice of many, Poland was born yet again, like a phoenix. Many things could be said about the Second Republic, but one was absolutely certain."
