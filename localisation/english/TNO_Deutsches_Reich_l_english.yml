 ## Events ##
 FHH.1.t: " Arms against Tyranny "
 FHH.1.a: " Blessed are the meek. "
 FHH.1.d:0 " Speidel was walking across Germania. He saw the true horror of the Nazi regime in its entirity. The centre of Europe, turned into a giant propaganda area. What didnt help was the exodus of slaves into the Schuttzone. Lots of jews coming out, begging for money. What didnt help was also the degeneracy of the Heer. Speidel has had enough. He will be a puppet of the Reichstag no longer! He will end Nazism and its terror on the volk here and now! But he is not alone. Several OKW officers had joined a meeting he held."But herr Speidel, are you sure this wont go wrong?" Stauffenberg asked. " My duty may be to the reich, but my loyalty is to the people. I dont want to see good people suffer under this stupid ideology made by a maniac!", Speidel replied. The room went silent. There's no turning back after this. They will either go down as the world's greatest heroes or its greatest failure... "
 FHH.2.t: "Return of Spartakus"
 FHH.2.a: "Hörst du die Leute singen?"
 FHH.2.d:0 "Willy Brandt, a man known to many as "Spartakus Reborn". Brandt is known for his lenient socialism and SPD leadership. He was to be Germany's most famous man. The Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold (An organization led by Brandt) had stopped fighting the Nazis after Speidel's proclamation. Willy made his way to the newly reconstructed Reichstag to hold a speech for his campaign. His oponents are his friends, the two Gang of Four members, Tresckow and Shmidt. The three friends decided to sit down for some afternoon tea. "So, how was Sweden?", Tresckow asked. "Yes, we want to hear your experience.", Shmidt said excitedly. "Fine. Fine. It was a boring experience but I still had some activities as the head of the Reichsbanner of course. However, I find more warmth in my german fatherland.", Brandt replied back. "That's nice, but will this election destroy our friendship?", Shmidt questioned. "Nonsense! We are simply competing against each. Obviously we HAVE to stay united because the Nazis are back and with Thalman up in Northern Germany, people are questioning if Speidel can handle this.", Tresckow said. "What about you, Henning? Can YOU handle it?" Brandt asked. Tresckow stayed silent. "Well I ought to go, it has been a fun time with you two but now, politics calls.", Brandt said leaving. Shmidt and Tresckow were happy to meet Brandt again after so long. It seems even in these trying times, friendship never dies. But one thing is for sure, the SPD has a hell of a headstart..."

Speidel concluded when meeting Speer."No,no no! I didnt do anything! I just wanted to focus on architecture for the Reich! This is false judgement!", Speer replied. "Oh please, spare me the talk. You are yourself the inventor of the holocaust and responsible for the hard work forced by the slaves in Germania! Take him away!", Speer replied with anger.\n\Speidel was hastily taken away from the court, never to be seen again"

Speidel announced the war will go on until Germany is united. But who shall listen? Even his generals have created their own cliques. Who can we trust after this?"
 FHH.5.t: "The Battle of Brandenburg"
 FHH.5.d:0 "It was this day when Speidel's eternal regency may end. Three sides battle it out.n/nThe SS, The Operationzone Sanktpetersburg remants lead by Dietrich Von Sauken and Speidel himself. WHo will win?"

 FHH.6.t: "The death of Bormann"

Suddenly, the car finally came. It carried Bormann and Stauffenberg. "Here's Bormann", Stauffenberg said. Bormann looked like he hadnt slept for a decade."We found him hiding in his office while searching through Munich""Good. Leave us", Speidel replied. Speidel looked over the Baldman that was Bormann, scared shitless. "I didnt go too much to give you a proper trial. God knows if you deserve one.", Speidel said to Bormann. "YOU UNTERMENSH! YOU ARE DESTROYING GERMANIA THIS WAY! WHAT WOULD HI-", before Bormann could finish, Speidel shot him. The rain stopped. Speidel left."

It ends, Speidels crusade was for nothing. It only brought back the Nazis with a more 'human' face..."
 FHH.8.a: "Heil Goebbels!"
 FHH.9.t: "Elections of Germany"
