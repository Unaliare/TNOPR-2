 murmansk_peace.1.t: "Finland Offers Surrender"
 murmansk_peace.1.desc: "Diplomats representing the Finnish government have approached us offering surrender once again. This time they have fully conceded to our demands and are offering to hand over Onega, Murmansk, and all of Karelia east of Viipuri. This would restore the border to its position in 1936 and bring millions of Russians back into the fold.\n\nWith our rightful territory returned to us and all questions of military supremacy definitely settled by our rout of the Finnish armed forces we have nothing else to gain from the war. It has been a triumphant return of the Russian nation to the world stage, with the reclamation of a valuable region and a decisive victory over a foreign rival to make it all the better.\n\nLet us make peace with the Finns and turn our attention to the east. Karelia was just the beginning. Soon all of Russia will be reunited under our flag."
 murmansk_peace.1.a: "Wonderful!"

 murmansk_peace.2.t: "Russia Accepts Our Surrender"
 murmansk_peace.2.desc: "Our diplomats have returned and informed us that the Russians have accepted our unconditional surrender. All of Karelia east of Viipuri will be returned to them and the border will return to its 1936 position. This is a devastating loss for our nation. Decades of work to restore the Finnish population of our eastern territories and enormous investments in those same regions have been undone. It was only because this sacrifice was necessary to preserve any form of an independent Finland that it was made. Our future that once seemed so bright is now slipping away from us as we fall back under the Russian shadow."
 murmansk_peace.2.a: "We flew too close to the sun."

 murmansk_peace.3.t: "Finland Offers Ceasefire"
 murmansk_peace.3.desc: "Though our soldiers have not managed to shatter the Finnish lines as we hoped, we are still making steady advances into their territory. Perhaps fearing that they will not be able to hold us off for much longer, or simply not wanting to expend the blood and treasure to repel us, the Finns have offered us a truce. They propose to cede Onega and the territories presently controlled by the Murmansk People's Republic to us in exchange for an end to the fighting. Shall we accept the treaty as they have offered it to us, or reject it and fight for greater gains?"

 murmansk_peace.6.desc: "Our soldiers have not managed to shatter the Finnish lines as we hoped, and it seems that the war, despite our best attempts and hopes, has stagnated. With frozen lines and from a position of strength, the Finns have offered us a truce in order to halt the fighting and return to a position of pre-war status quo with regards to their borders.\n\nThey propose to cede Onega to us in exchange for an end to the fighting, with the stipulation that the former territories of Onega shall remain demilitarised. With the present stagnation of the conflict, more and more mobilised Finnish reserves every day, and international pressure from Europe against us, we cannot hope to achieve our strategic goals. We have no choice but to accept this poisoned pill, and hope that some day we will be able to recover our lost lands through other means."

 murmansk.11.t: "The Heroes of Murmansk"
 murmansk.11.desc: "Rumours have started to leak from our former provinces inside East Karelia. Wrongly stolen from us under the apocalypse that was Operation Barbarossa, it seems that the perfidious Finns have had a hard time trying to keep their ill-gotten gains. While tales from the naive and the hopeful have always leaked to us about a "general Russian uprising" in our lost lands, it seems that there's more truth to this gossip than there was before.\n\nIn the city of Murmansk especially, discontent against the occupying Finns have reached a boiling point. If something isn't done, it seems that Helsinki will have a full-blown insurgency on their hands - something, in their political atmosphere, that they can scarcely handle. However, when a door closes for some, a window opens for others. Some leading members in the Murmansk seperatist movement have graciously reached out to us for aid and assistance in their upcoming struggle against the Republic. Sir, we should consider this offer for if we do supply them, and they should succeed - who's to say that they wouldn't want to join their brothers in Russia proper?"

 murmansk.21.t: "Let Slip the Hounds of War"
 murmansk.21.desc: "The rebellion has begun. Our sources were correct, for once, and a general insurgency against Finnish forces has driven the Finnish Defence Forces out of the Kola Province and cleared the city of Murmansk. A glorious victory in its own right, to be sure, but it is only the beginning. Given a bloody nose, yes, but beaten? This is only the first phase of a struggle between Us and Them. The Russian and the Finn will come to blows once more - and they shall not be alone.\n\nThe port of Murmansk has always been the first port of call for foreigners and supplies. This time, Murmansk will be home to people much closer to home. Our volunteers have already been trained and equipped by us to fight alongside our brethren inside the MPR. It's these legions that will face the brunt of the Finnish Army and take them out, while their numbers are ground down by the Murmanskite partisans until they have no choice but to evacuate from their conquests. Then, and only when Helsinki is humiliated to the prying eyes of the World, shall Murmansk and East Karelia be returned to us - as it should have been, all along."

 FIN.125.t: "The Finns' Cowardice"
 FIN.125.desc: "Service for safety and peace. In exchange for martial sacrifice our families would be returned to us. Today, Helsinki's demonstrates their complete lack of dignity and their overwhelming disregard for our lives with the newest set of orders delivered to our high command. Despite our clear martial superiority, we are to surrender to the Russians.\n\nEvery single person in our high command is confused by this development. We are bleeding the Russians dry, and they have completely failed to penetrate our defenses. Have the Finns lost their stomach for war? Have they decided they won't sacrifice Finnish lives for some "measly Russians?" Has Helsinki lost their minds entirely?\n\nMaybe if the Finns are surrendering so early it means that the Russian government is just and not deserving of such bloodshed. Maybe this government is run by truly sensible men and women, compared to those traitorous Bolsheviks and lunatic fascists. Our men wait for our generals to give the command. These men have prepared for this fight for a long time, they might yet follow us into a bloody last stand. However, this last stand would be our forces alone, no Finnish assistance will be provided. This fight will likely be bloody, brutal, and quite possibly futile. Perhaps it is better to take our chances with this new government and lay down our arms in peace?"
 FIN.125.a: "May this new Russia be led by more merciful men than the last."

 FIN.150.t: "A Monster On The Sonar Screen"
 FIN.150.desc: "At first, it was believed to be a mistake. When the Radar operator on the FNS Karjala reported a blob on his screen, larger than he'd ever seen, it was initially laughed off as a ridiculous glitch by the bridge. The laughing died fairly quickly when the FNS Turunmaa reported the same blob, and then numerous other patrol boats. A quick call and a hasty reconnaissance flight confirmed the worst fears of the government- the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe were out in full force.\n\nBattleships, Bombers, Fighters and Frigates- it was all there. Hell, the recon flight even reported seeing a few converted Swedish ships in the forefront of the pack.\n\nObviously, the message behind this show of force is clear. We will bend the knee to Göring and his gang of lunatics, or we will be wiped off the face of the Earth. While this decision is not to be made yet- they haven't asked about it specifically- some of our more aggressive admirals already recommend an immediate course of action. Their plan is to send out our own ships in a counter exercise, in order to show the strong will of the Finnish people and our government's refusal to back down. This, however, could lead to further conflict.\n\nThe other plan, recommended by much of the civilian government, is to do nothing and let them bluster. To pick a fight with the strongest navy in Northern Europe is to send thousands of men to die, and will only lead to trouble for us. However, simply letting the Germans walk over us is a terrible look, and will only invite further aggression. We are in between a rock and a hard place, and every minute we wait leads to us being squished further. A choice must be made."
 FIN.150.a: "Send out the Navy."

 FIN.151.t: "All Hands On Deck"
 FIN.151.desc: "The Finnish government was thrown into chaos today as new reports sent shockwaves across the military. The FNS Karelia reported a strange, threatening new move from the German menace. A small detachment of German ships has been spotted, moving away from the main fleet. It is alone, weak, and also intruding on Finnish national waters. Of course, this move severely threatens Finnish national security. If we do not stop the Germans here and now, and protect our sovereign waters, what will stop the GErmans from simply ignoring our naval claims? Because of this, the military has put forth a plan to fire upon the violating ships, and drive them from our waters as a reminder of Finnish sovereignty. Perhaps losing a few thousand men to the frigid waters of the Baltic will put a message through Göring's thick skull.\n\nHowever, this plan has been met with fear and fury from the political elite, who claim that the Finnish navy is no match for the Kriegsmarine. Indeed, spme go as far as to call this a German trick, intent on fooling us into destroying our own navy, Both sides argue this issue as if it is life and death, which it very well may be. We must choose a course of action against this unprecedented threat."
 FIN.151.a: "It's a trick. Send nothing out."

 FIN.152.t: "Slaughter in the Baltic"
 FIN.152.desc: "The admiral watched with growing joy as his fleet gained on the Germans. Their ships, puny in number compared to the Finns sent to destroy them, fled before the Finnish Navy. The admiral slowly looked at the armada amassed around him. Every ship in the Finnish Navy had been sallied forth to destroy the foolish Germans, whose arrogance had led them to believe that Finland would simply roll over and allow their sovereignty to be trampled. How stupid of them!\n\nEven as the Germans tried to flee, they must have known that their days were numbered. The Finns outnumbered them, outgunned them, and were now in firing range. The last point was proven when the first salvo was fired, splashing all around the enemy. The admiral couldn't help but crack a grin as the first shots connected, and the slaughter began.\n\nThat is, until he heard the sirens wail above him.\n\nThe admiral, in his startled, looked up to see the full might of the Luftwaffe above him. The sun flashed off the wings of the dive bombers as they unloaded their payloads on to numerous ships. The admiral, along with his crew, watched in stark horror as the first boats buckled and cracked under the weight of the assault, explosions tearing their hulls apart.\n\nAs the admiral watched his pride and joy burn away in front of him, he noticed a plane coming for the ship he stood on. He would only have a moment to comprehend what it was doing before the blast of the bomb engulfed him."
 FIN.152.a: "How could we have fallen for it?"

 FIN.153.t: "An Unusually Large Blip"
 FIN.153.desc: "When the sonar operator of the FNS Karjala reported a major blip on his screen, he was first treated with incredulous. When the sonar operator of the FNS Turunmaa reported a similar blip, the air of confusion was replaced with that of dread. A quick reconnaissance flight confirmed the fleet's suspicions- Germany had sent out its fleet, and planes to back it up.\n\nHundreds of planes soar over the bulk of the Kriegsmarine, as they cut through the icy waters of the Baltic. Of course, the flimsy excuse of "simple exercises" provided by the German Embassy have been all but ignored by the government, who sees it as it really is- Germany is back, and it will destroy Finland if we do not comply. For a while, however, it seemed that nothing would truly come of it. The Kriegsmarine did its exercises halfheartedly while part of the Navy stood as a guard for the coast. It seemed that the situation would defuse on its own.\n\nUnfortunately, it wouldn't. Our ships have repeatedly reported small flights of Luftwaffe bombers buzzing their decks, flying directly over them and occasionally diving as if to attack only to pull away at the last minute. This situation has sent our admirals into a frenzy, as they demand to send more ships to the coast to counter these acts of aggression. Increasing the tension in this situation seems to be a terrible idea, but leaving our ships undefended is just as bad. We must make a choice, unfortunately."

 FIN.154.t: "Åland Seized!"
 FIN.154.desc: "Our government was once again thrown into chaos yesterday as a shocking development came from the Åland islands. In a series of increasingly desperate messages, the garrison stationed on the islands relayed information thought to be impossible- Wehrmacht forces have landed and seized the islands, presumably as a jumping off point for a future invasion of our homeland. While Göring has made his fair share of threats against us, our nation, and our future, never has he seized our territory so brazenly, or threatened us so openly.\n\nOur parliament is now split into pieces, as shock and terror runs rampant among our populace. While most of our leaders, including almost all of the generals and admirals, demand that a state of war be declared, our army is not yet entirely ready to hold the German menace back in the case of war. The more pragmatic men among our legislation argue that we continue our policy of retaining and conserving our resources, rather than expending all of our assets over a few rocks in the Baltic. Though this would undoubtedly be an unpopular choice with the hawks, perhaps preparing a defensive struggle will be a more successful strategy. Either way, we must now make our choice."
 FIN.154.a: "We must defend our territory!"

 FIN.155.t: "The Battle of Åland"
 FIN.155.desc: "Shocking news has returned from the Åland Islands, as has been a constant in the last few weeks. However, this news is different, in that it is positive. According to frenzied reports from the local garrison, Göring and his band of gangsters attempted an attack on our islands, and would have succeeded had it not been for the swift action of our navy. With the quick thinking and swift action emblematic of a true Finnish warrior, our navy obliterated the landing force, sending thousands of German thugs to rot at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nRaucous celebration and joyous parades have sprung up in major population centers, and already our legislature has come together to issue a statement proclaiming our unity in the face of such adversity. However, some questions have arisen in terms of what we are to do, now that the Germans have been thoroughly defeated. Many of the more hawkish men in our government push for an immediate declaration of war, claiming that this battle shows our superiority to the massed, conscripted men in the Wehrmacht. Other, more pacifistic men have instead pushed for a continuance of our armed neutrality, as they claim that Göring will focus elsewhere after this defeat. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but the fact remains that our men, in a stand up fight against the numbers and equipment of the Wehrmacht, would be facing long odds. Whichever we choose, we can only hope we only win victories such as this."
 FIN.155.a: "Press the advantage! To war!"
 FIN.155.b: "We've shown we have claws."
 
 
 ### 156
 FIN.156.t: "The Ultimatum"
 FIN.156.desc: "Though previous news between us and the Reich has sent the government into a fearful panic, nothing compares to the latest passage sent to us. In near disbelief, the government sits paralyzed, and all because of one quick note directly from Germania. In this note, Göring himself writes in great detail of the great historical relationship between Finn and German, as if we have not been skirmishing with the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe for the last few months. The first paragraph is laden with compliments to our racial stock, our history, our tradition of "beating back the Bolshevik Russian", and our people. If one was to cut out the first paragraph and only read that, they may think that this was a love letter.\n\nThe second paragraph is decidedly less friendly.\n\nIn the second paragraph, Göring notes the statistics of the Wehrmacht compared to our forces, the disparity in training and manpower, and the hopelessness of our situation. He concludes the letter with a simple offer- join the Einheitspakt, or die.\n\nThis is no easy thing to answer, as Finnish society tears itself apart over what this may mean for Finland. We must make a choice- can we fend off the Germans for long enough, but run the risk of destruction? Or shall we submit to the Reich's claws, and live to see another day?"
 FIN.156.a: "We have no choice."
 FIN.156.b: "We will not lay down and die!"
 
 
 ### 157
 FIN.157.t: "A Second Ultimatum"
 FIN.157.desc: "The war continues, and with it comes a heavy cost. Thousands of Finnish men die on the field of battle every week, as the German tide slowly grows stronger and stronger. At home, the cities alternate between the silence of a strict curfew and the chaos of daily bombing raids. The countryside slowly empties, either from the men going to war or the people leaving for the safety of the interior. Above all else, our economy falters, with all trade being cut off from the entire world. It seems if we continue this war, the nation may be doomed.\n\nGöring, unbelievably enough, has given us out in the form of a second ultimatum. This letter is significantly more blunt and harsh than the last. There are no formalities or pleasantries. Indeed, the letter is but a paragraph in length. The new ultimatum would, upon our acceptance of the terms, simply incorporate us into Reichskommissariat Skandinavien. There would be no autonomy, or freedom, or any other special circumstance for us, but our people would live to see another day.\n\nHowever, our generals still push to continue the fight. By the observations of both our economists and our military men, the German giant stands on extremely weak legs, buoyed only by the loot of those nations who have fallen to it. If we hold long enough, the Reich may fall in on itself again, allowing us to escape with our independence, our freedom, and above all else, our pride. This would be risky, but in the situation we are in, it must be considered.\n\nWe now come to what may be the greatest crossroad in Finnish history- do we give in and submit to Göring and his thugs, or take a great risk and keep fighting, for the chance of survival?"
 FIN.157.a: "We cannot keep fighting."
 FIN.157.b: "Never surrender!"

 POLITICS_JUHA_RIHTNIEMI_DESC: "There are two types of politicians - loud, brash showmen who embrace loud and brash policies, and the quiet workhorses without which all world governments would collapse in seconds. Juha Rihtniemi is one such man - intensely patriotic, from a family deeply involved in politics, and focused on the well-being of his people and his own personal interest in fully returning East Karelia to the Finnish fold.\n\nWhen the roof fell in on the German economy and mud splashed all over the faces of the National Coalition Party's most high ranking, Juha remained clean - and with a reputation as a diligent, experienced functionary who handled the West Russian War calmly and neatly, he was elected President with a whopping 72% of the vote.\n\nJuha's time as President has been spent slowly but surely developing the nation even as it continues to walk the tightrope between the German behemoth and the shattered titan of Russia as it gradually begins to pull itself together once more. Though he has authorised significant funding of Finnish units in Onega as a bulwark against the Russian menace, it is all too self evident that sooner or later, Finland's old enemy will return once more to claw away Karelia from the motherland. To that effect, programs to teach Finnish to the Karelian populace, settle Finns in significant numbers, and deport the Russians still remaining have all received generous support under his administration."

 FIN_An_Unsatisfactory_Answer_desc: "Karelia and Murmansk have finally rejoined the Finnish homeland - the time has come to rejoice!\n\n...Or so it would have been, but in truth both these lands have been nothing but a headache and drain on the coffers of the country. Red partisans infest the forests, and though much of the 'non-ethnic' population of Karelia has been deported to Onega, Murmansk remains as a thoroughly Russian thorn jabbing at the side of the state. Until these issues are resolved, the "Eastern Question" remains open, and the answer we have now may not be enough to preserve all that has been built over two decades when the Russians inevitably come knocking again."

In reality, the IKL and other right-wing movements find the strength from... somewhere to strongarm politicians, fight partisans in the East without government sanction, and in general pull the strings throughout the halls of power without rightfully wearing the crown. This shadowy support makes the Finnish far-right much harder to weaken than it should be at a first glance, and means that the number of seats controlled by the IKL in Parliament means nothing but a red herring to mislead unwary observers as to how much power it wields."

With an export regime characterised by technically advanced products - both industrial and agricultural - disciplined and competitive state corporations working in cooperation with banks design organisations, and a high rate of public savings, the Finnish economy has grown by leaps and bounds. Additionally, the influx of resources from the new Eastern territories and from Russia via Onega, and close cooperation with Sweden in terms of exports to Germany, have resulted in what many international observers call Europe's success story in a time marked otherwise by economic bleakness."

 FIN_Johannes_Virolainen_hog_desc: "The Finnish tongue has a long and benighted history compared with Swedish, but it is ours nonetheless - Finns all, from Helsinki to Karelia. Especially Karelia - our land, robbed from us for nearly half a century, but no longer. The lone man who fights for the rights of Finn Karelians is Johannes Virolainen - the only man who cares, Vyborg born, who knows their struggle.\n\nHe may be controversial to some. However, the need to settle Finns in their native land, and expel the foreigners from land that is not theirs - may not be... palatable to those who care more for foreign responses than actions. Pruning those who care about Finland from those who do not is an entirely different question. One that is guaranteed to be resolved the correct way.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is clear that some are born to see the whole picture - and some are born to actually deal with it. Johannes Virolairen is one of those men who will nominate scapegoats for the nation's sake - a patriot thinking only of the nation's greater good. Either way, he needs to enter power..."

 FIN_Asko_Ivalo_for_desc: "The art of diplomacy is a delicate one, and often involves knowing when to draw powerful neighbours close, and when to keep them at arm's length. Asko Ivalo knows this all too well, as one of Helsinki's most experienced diplomats, and one of the architects of Finland's current close relations with the Reich.\n\nEver since the rebirth of the modern nation of Finland, powerful neighbours have sought to 'rectify' the anomaly of her independence - and the ever-present solution has always been to draw closer to the one nation that never had and never will have territorial designs on even a square metre of Finnish soil. As a member of the SS Voluntary Committee of '42, Ivalo sealed in iron and blood the nation's commitment to Germany's cause by helping organise a Waffen-SS division of Finnish volunteers, and continues to support pro-German policies within the Finnish government, both out of pragmatism and to ensure the continued loyalty of the IKL and the powerful shadows lurking in the corners of power, seeking closer alignment with the Pakt as a whole."

 FIN_Paivio_Hetemaki_eco_desc: "In a world where the ties between nations have been torn apart, Päiviö Hetemäki seeks to rebuild Finland's link to the global market. In fact, most of his programme can be described in terms of rebuilding - of the relations between employers and workers, of economic ties with both Western Europe and the United States, and of Finnish worker's wages.\n\nOwing to this he also forms part of the bloc supporting further market integration with Europe as a whole, and thus for Albert Speer's reformist group in far-away Germania. It remains to be seen if his moderate, rational policies can survive when it seems the most chaotic years of Finland's history are fast approaching, but for now he marches on, slowly but steadily."

 FIN_Pekka_Malinen_sec_desc: "Once Prime Minister, Pekka Malinen now serves as Defence Minister - an important transition that allows him to ensure the continuation of his policies of ensuring Finland keeps what it has earned, and deserved for so long.\n\nHaving served several tours of combat as a member of the SS, Malinen found himself in the political wilderness following his tenure during the West Russian War - until it was realised that he, and his Finnish People's Party, were far too influential to exclude from government - this, despite the relatively small size of the party. Now, his policies revolve around the same three tenets - increasing support for Onega as the vanguard of the nation, increasing the military budget, and expanding the military infrastructure in Karelia to more rapidly deploy forces against the ever-present partisan threat."
