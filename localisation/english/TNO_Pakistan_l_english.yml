 POLITICS_MAHMUD_AHMED_DESC:0 "Mahmud Ahmed was not born a terrorist. He was born a Muslim in Ludhiana, during the first days of the Republic of India. His childhood was hardly noteworthy, and no different from that of a typical Muslim child in India. However, nobody is born a villain - or, if you ask the disturbingly large number of Ahmed's supporters, a hero.\n\nNobody has a unified consensus on where Ahmed learned of the methods of terrorism and other ideas in the name of national liberation. According to some, he took inspiration from the INA's tactics in the Indian War of Independence. According to himself, he was, as a young boy, gifted an ayah by Allah himself, who told him of the necessity for a Jihad against the Hindu. He avoided conscription so that he would not serve the Hindu, and fled to the mountains across the loose border. It was here that he disappeared into the mountains, and received further ayahs from the Greatest.\n\nIt has now been years since he disappeared, and Ahmed has returned to free his people. Fighting alongside his numerous followers, he is known as al-Azad, or "the Free" in Urdu. His plan is to oust the Hindu from the Land of the Pure at any cost, and to build a new Islamic state on the ashes of what will be burnt down. After years, centuries of oppression, the time has come for all Muslims of India to break the chains that bind them, in the name of Faith, Unity, and Discipline. And just as those great warriors of Islam fought against Christianity, Ahmed and the Mujahideen fight against the Hindu kafirs, and for the glory of Allah."
