 POLITICS_TAIK_CHUN_DESC:0 "Unlike Moe Lunn, very few expected Taik Chun as a leader. Many saw him, alongside his association with the Thakins, as demonstrative of his position as a follower. However, in the heat of battle, it was a much different story; fighting against the Karen, he pulled off some of the most integral moves necessary to repel them, and prevent their independence.\n\nNow, defying expectations yet again, Taik Chun has taken up the sword against the Bamar foe. With an alliance alongside his former foes, the Karen, along with many new allies, he fights for the freedom of the Chin people. While some worry about his former association with the Thakin, he has promised that he has nothing but the best interests of the Chin in mind."
