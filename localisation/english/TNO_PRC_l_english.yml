 ### Leader Desc ###
 PRC_Aleksandr_Vasilevsky: "Aleksandr Vasilevsky" 
 POLITICS_ALEKSANDER_VASILEVSKY_DESC: "Aleksandr Mikhailovich Vasilevsky was the son of a Russian Orthodox priest and was expected to follow in his father's footsteps, but he was drawn to a military life and traded his seminarian's robes for a soldier's uniform. He fought in the Imperial Russian Army and rose through the ranks, but resigned his post during the October Revolution and spent much of the Russian Civil War commanding soldiers well behind the front lines. In the interwar years, he distinguished himself as a skilled organizer, and befriended other notable officers such as Kliment Voroshilov, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, and Georgy Zhukov. When the Germans invaded, Vasilevsky was serving in Bukharin's general staff, and his ability to work well under pressure helped him rise through the ranks. But not even his skills could stop the evacuation of Moscow from degenerating into a mad stampede as soldiers, bureaucrats, and millions of civilians desperately fighting each other for a coveted safe passage out of the city.\n\nDetermined to help as much of the Red Army to survive as possible, Vasilevsky organized a semi-orderly retreat of the forces that escaped the Mozhaisk defense line and marched east, over the Urals. Their goal: the Mongolian People's Republic, where they could regroup and resume the offensive. But the opportunity never came, for the Japanese and their puppet state of Mengjiang had already invaded Ulaanbaatar and forced the remnants of the Mongolian Army into the steppes. Vasilevsky formed a tenuous alliance with the Mongolians, and the two armies set up a domain in western Mongolia and the former Tuvan People's Republic. They were isolated from the West Russian War, the Siberian War and the fall of the People's Republic of Western Siberia. They gladly avoided Yagoda's government in Irkutsk, fearful that he would label their retreat as cowardice and have them shot for treason. But despite having no allies, Vasilevsky is still determined to rally his men, draft the battle plans, and fight their way back home."

The Mongolian People's Republic, which had been reduced to a Soviet puppet before the Great Patriotic War, suddenly found itself as the host of Red Army units stranded, and having lost their chain of command. Through a slow and complex process, the Mongolian government would slowly merge with the Russian military, and despite the invasion from Mengjiang, survive on the edge of the country. After years of hardships, the Red Army has survived Japan's facade of pan-Asianism, Yagoda's totalitarianism, and internal strife between its leaders. Now, the troops wonder if their eternal exile in Mongolia will ever end."

PRC_factionalism: "Directional Disputes"
PRC_factionalism_desc: "There are many arguments between the leading figures of the People's Revolutionary Council on policies of governance and what its ultimate goal is. That is to be expected, though, when the nation is controlled by a loose coalition of Russians and Mongols, that only have their wish for survival and adherence to socialist doctrine in common. These disagreements have often led to infighting within the ranks of the regime, and taking decisive action can be difficult without upsetting one faction or the other. However, if the People's Revolutionary Council wants to survive into the future, or even restore the Union, the disputes will have to be solved."

PRC_democratic_military: "Democratic Military"
PRC_democratic_military_desc: "Soldiers in the Red Army elect their own officers, in order to move beyond the reactionary hierarchies that dominate militaries of old. However, this decision has had consequences. Soldiers won't elect officers for their qualifications and skill, and they won't elect officers who'll make the hard decisions when needed. They'll elect officers who are popular, who go easy on their men. This means that men often get promoted to positions that they are most certainly not qualified to hold."

Aleksandr Vasilevsky and his Russians have goals of reuniting the Soviet Union under the Red Army, yet native opposition has opposed these goals.\n\nThe Mongol faction would much rather stay in Mongolia and preserve a Mongol nation, opposing goals of unification.

PRC_The_Eastern_Conflict_desc: "The People's Revolutionary Council has established itself and has a fair amount of control over the western fringes of Mongolia. However, we wish we could say the same for the rest of the nation, as it has come under the yoke of Mengjiang, nothing more than proxies for the Japanese imperialists and their Chinese lapdogs.\n\nIn spite of that, not all hope is lost, and light can be seen at the end of the tunnel. Under the leadership of Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, the Mongolians have risen up once again to drive their oppressors out of their rightful lands. They might be facing Mengjiang and, therefore, the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere, but the hope of liberation never fades away. These times are equally important for the Council as well; we must seek to find what our approach will be, and whether we will come to the rescue of the revolutionaries or remain alone in our struggle for survival."
PRC_Fortify_the_Border_desc: "The frontier between the Council and the autonomous territory of Mengjiang, while in legal terms non-existent, is in fact defined by a series of checkpoints, roads, and natural landmarks running across Western Mongolia. While it is clearly not the optimal area for an army to go through, we do not know to what extent Mengjiang will go to if they assert their control over Mongolia once again. Thus, we must use this window of opportunity, where we are not threatened by the Japanese puppets on the frontier, to fortify it.\n\nUsing knowledge from the great wars of the Soviet Union and the skirmishes we have had with the rival Mongolian government, we can start installing defensive installations to protect us. Small forts, hideouts where the troops can't be seen, and other similar constructions will be built. Should Mengjiang push further, and threaten our existence as a whole, we must be prepared."
PRC_Prepare_the_Men_desc: "The threat of war begins to loom over the People's Revolutionary Council, and everyone can sense it. In the streets of Kyzyl and Uliastay, the calm before the storm is apparent. People prepare for the worst, and so should the army. As it stands now, the military is a formidable force, almost reminiscent of the glory days of the Far Eastern Military District. However, if it is to stand up against a Japanese-backed army, something more will be needed. To ensure that we have the upper hand in the possibility of all-out war, mobilization must begin. Drawing from what little manpower the desolate Mongolian steppes have to offer us, more men must be recruited and trained. The last thing we would want is to enter a great, nation-deciding conflict, only to be overwhelmed by the unexpected advantage."
PRC_Favor_the_Mongolians_desc: "One issue has plagued the state lying in the Mongolian steppes ever since its very foundation, and that is the debate of ethnicities. The Mongolians, living a nomadic life in the steppes or having settled into one of the towns that are so rare to find in the desolate west, have often felt ignored, or even oppressed. This seemed a logical conclusion: after all, it was the Russians who had forced the communist regime on these lands, it was them that had sent the troops to occupy them, and it was these troops that now had the absolute control.\n\nWe must seek to change this perception. This state must be founded on equality between the different nationalities, and the Mongolians must become equals as well. They will receive more positions in the army high command and the bureaucracy that runs much of the country. In fact, one should not be surprised if the balance tilts in favor of the Mongolians once again."
PRC_Favor_the_Russians_desc: "Ever since the foundation of the People's Revolutionary Council, the people at its helm became clear, and they were all Russian officers. The Mongolian authorities were slowly sidelined, seeing as they could not offer much and were incompetent or even corrupt. Despite the calls for equality and respect to the Mongolians, which we have already granted to a great extent, the experienced Red Army officers from the days of the Great Patriotic War must continue to lead the state as long as it's still in danger. We should also not forget that there is a sizeable Russian population in Tuva, comparable to the sparse settlements of Mongolians in their lands. They should be given benefits, so as to earn their trust in the Council."
PRC_Recruitment_campaign_desc: "If we are to be ready for when war finally comes to Western Mongolia and Tuva, having a powerful army is of utmost importance. While we have already began mobilization efforts, to strengthen our units and expand them, it appears that this has not been enough to reach the level of manpower we hoped for. After tense discussions between the High Command, we have decided that there is only one solution left: relax recruitment requirements, and send even more men into the army. More people, of younger and older ages, will be eligible. Additionally, even if one has a small medical problem, they shall be recruited as well. We must reach new extremes, if we want to see the Council survive these turbulent times."
PRC_Legacy_of_the_Siberian_Red_Army_desc: "The Siberian War was a tragedy for all sides involved: the Central Siberian Republic and Yagoda's government endlessly clashed, and the result was nothing more than many deaths and the collapse of both states. The People's Revolutionary Council remained out of this bloody affair, but it did not look away from the frontlines. In fact, we kept a close eye on the conflict, and aside from ensuring we were never threatened by either side, we learnt many lessons from it. One of the most important ones was that of military tactics; Yagoda's soldiers fought using the tactics of the Old Red Army, and so did the CSR for the most part. This can be particularly useful as we find ourselves on the verge of war once again. Our generals must closely examine the battles of the Siberian War and the strategies use, so that when the time comes to fight, we have a better chance."
PRC_Give_More_Rights_desc: "The leadership of the Council, divided as it may be, has made one common agreement in these times of trouble, and that is to give more freedom to the population. Our wishes for the true socialist miracle to be achieved have been set back by the emergency we find ourselves in: the situation is dire, resources are scarce, but enemies are plenty. However, some room to move in has been found, and the High Command of the Far Eastern Military District has authorized a plan to give the people of the Council, especially the Mongolians, more rights.\n\nThe main change will be to allow them to continue the nomadic lifestyle to a certain extent, should they wish so, but still heavily encouraging settlement and adopting the communist ideals. Furthermore, the rights to assembly will be changed slightly, and discrimination between the different ethnicities occupying the Council's land will be cracked down. The hope is that all this will ensure the nation lives in solidarity, and no problems arise."
PRC_Military_Industry_desc: "As many across the world know, industry is always the backbone of a nation and a military force. Without it, there are no guns for the troops to carry into battle, nor tanks to use, nor planes to fly above the battlefield. It would be optimal for our army to enjoy dozens of industrial complexes fully dedicated to supporting it, but in the environment we are in, that's not plausible in a short amount of time. If we want to integrate the factories into the war effort in time to defend our lands, then the only option is to steal from the civilian sector. What few factories we have at our disposal will have to urgently be renovated and converted, in order to serve the Council. Machine parts will be switched out, assembly lines replaced or twisted, all for the good of the country."
PRC_An_Elite_Army_desc: "In the quest to form a proper army, one that can truly face a formidable enemy, quality can often be better than quantity. It is better to have the world's greatest army of just a few thousand troops, than to have a massive horde, badly equipped and badly trained. To achieve this in the Council, we can reduce the amount of men we recruit, in return for ensuring that every one of them can offer the most in the battlefield. The men shall be carefully selected, being fit and able to fight effectively. They shall all be armed with the best guns and equipment we have to offer, and they will be trained carefully, until they are ready to enter the war. The high command hopes that, this way, we will no longer be a disorganized force, but an elite one, that will be able to stand up to any enemy."
PRC_Mobilize_the_Economy_desc: "The economy of the People's Revolutionary Council, while quite small in size, is just the same as that of any socialist power in practice. We have based it on that of the old Soviet Union, despite its many differences that are a result of our dire situation. Now, war is on the horizon, and this economy will need to be properly prepared to support the Council by whatever means. What is needed is for a general mobilization of the economy to begin - as Mengjiang comes closer and closer to launching their inevitable attack on us, the country needs to be set on a war footing. More funds will be put into military production, while war measures like rations will slowly be introduced. If this goes well, then we will be ready for whatever comes next."
PRC_Improve_Our_Weapons_desc: "An army always needs the best weapons possible if they want to fight a war effectively. Unfortunately for us, unless we clash with the warlord states to our north, we will have to face the extremely modernized armies of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. This has made most officers in our military consider the expansion and, most importantly, the modernization of our weapon arsenals important. Using a combination of leftover depots, old Soviet designs and new Japanese ones, we can make an effort to make changes the guns we produce. We must focus on making beneficial tweaks, but tweaks that do not affect the resources required to produce them, or hopefully even reduce them. That way, our minor armament industry will be more effective in its aim."
PRC_Last_Preparations_desc: "If we are to truly wage war against our largest enemy, we cannot simply send our army as it stands into Western Mongolia and expect them to win. Extensive preparations must be made, and plans drafted, in anticipation of the all-out attack. More men will be called to serve in the Red Army of the Far East, and slowly, mobilization will begin. Aside from manpower, the economy is equally or perhaps even more important: production must be exponentially increased, for an army cannot function without the necessary equipment. If this preparation is carried out quickly and effectively, then we shall head into the war with a real hope of victory."
PRC_War_with_Menjiang_desc: "In the principal Mongolian city of Ulaanbaatar, the flag of the revolutionaries has been torn down, replaced by the flag of the traitorous Inner Mongolians that obey every order of Nanjing and Tokyo. In the far eastern border of the People's Revolutionary Council, thousands of people arrive, from troops that had rebelled, to innocent civilians seeking to flee Mengjiang's rule. Tsedenbal's rebellion has been defeated, and the rebels have been captured or forced to a humiliating retreat. As our enemy re-establishes their control, it is only logical to assume that we are their next targets.\n\nThus, we must make the first move, to catch them by surprise and increase our chances as much as possible. The Soviet army of the Far East will be the one to begin the assault, well prepared to strike and combat any resistance offered by the enemy, that has only now cleared the area of the Mongolian People's Front. We can only hope this war goes well."
PRC_Backline_Defense_desc: "Defense is not always just fighting the enemy advance on the frontlines. The Council must be prepared for every possible scenario in the war, and extensive preparations in case of a general enemy breakthrough would be prudent. By organizing defense lines not right on the front, but further behind, as far as the lands of Tuva, we can be more sure that we will never be in immediate danger of complete collapse.\n\nThese fortifications will be built based on previous knowledge, combined with the experience from the first battles with Mengjiang. While some in the High Command have argued that this would mean diverting precious resources from the main front, for most, it's better to be safe than sorry."
PRC_Guns_From_the_Great_Patriotic_War_desc: "During the Great Patriotic War, Bukharin's Soviet Union amassed a large army to fight the Germans. While in the end, it was not enough to achieve victory, its scattered remains and their equipment survived in some places, and the same thing happened in the lands the Council occupies. Tuva and Mongolia saw the deployment of Red Army troops, as Vasilevsky's proud units raced to take control of them before Japan did. While this was obviously not entirely successful, these areas are still filled with old depots containing arms and ammunition. These resources, long forgotten, must be brought back into the light and be used by our armies, as they must use everything at their disposal for the good of the Council."
PRC_War_Propaganda_desc: "The population of the People's Revolutionary Council is, quite obviously, hesitant about taking part in a war. Even if that war is about their own survival, some still don't do everything they can to help their government survive. If we want to ensure that every citizen gives 100% of their potential to contribute to the war effort, propaganda is always a good solution. It has been tried many, many times, and has often succeeded in rallying a population. The best example we should look up to is the old Soviet Union, that despite all their military failures, used propaganda from the time it was founded until it fell to the Nazi menace.\n\nBasing ourselves on the old communist tactics, we will begin spreading posters, slogans and more, to encourage the Russians, Tuvans and Mongolians to take part in the war; whether they join the army, help in the factories, or just spread the message, they will be helpful."
PRC_Red_Shells_desc: "Since its inception, artillery has proven itself to be one of the most effective weapons to use in combat. Even in the First World War, its use became universal: before an attack to overwhelm enemy defenses, an intense and unforgiving barrage of artillery strikes on the enemy lines can be enough to disorganize and demoralize them. To this day, showering the ennemy under a barrage of lead continues to be an important tool of combat. As a nation in war, it is only logical we seek to find all artillery we have at our disposal, produce it and integrate it into our army. The factories, busy as they are constantly putting out equipment, will now have the additional task of producing shells to fire and cannons to bombard with."
PRC_Expand_Conscription_desc: "Time flies, and the pool of available manpower to use in the frontlines shrinks bit by bit, days by days. More and more men die in their brave fight for the reconquest of the Far East, some to protect their homelands, but many simply to survive. We have already taken extensive measures to ensure we have an adequate number of men ready to call into the battlefield, but even that seems to be not enough. Conscription must be expanded once more, to cover anyone who is able to serve for the army. Young men, who may not even be considered adults yet, shall be recruited. The older generation, that might even faintly remember the events of the Civil War, will have to be drafted as well. Even women that wish to volunteer for the good of their country will be welcomed. As the saying goes, desperate times call for desperate measures."
PRC_Evacuate_Western_Mongolia_desc: "We have survived battle after battle, making our stands in every town and village as the troops of the enemy made their way into the depths of Mongolia. But as much as we have done everything we can to ensure the survival of our lands, it could all soon come crashing down. The army of the Council is under severe pressure, constantly being routed and forced to retreat further. This seems like a dire situation, but there is one solution, the final resort.\n\nTuva is a mountainous land, distinct from the rest of Mongolia. Conquering it will never be particularly easy for any power. If we were to stop wasting resources and men into defending every inch of Mongolia, and reorganize in the small and easily controllable territory of Tuva, then perhaps the People's Revolutionary Council could have a chance to survive the war."
PRC_Last_Stand_desc: "The endless struggle against Mengjiang continues, now more intense than ever. While we have often engaged in wars, conflicts and skirmishes with their government, never before has the situation be so critical to the future of Mongolia. Across the mountains and deserts, we fight with everything we have, yet it still seems far from enough to ensure our survival and eventual victory. It is time, as we are in an extremely dangerous position, to truly give one hundred percent of our potential, in resources, military power, and morale, as small as those things may be, for the defense of the Council. The army shall be given the orders to not take one step back, and defend every inch of soil against the Japanese puppets. No matter what, we cannot afford to lose this war."
PRC_Offer_a_Peace_Deal_desc: "After weeks of a hard war, that has raged across the mountains and deserts of Mongolia, we still stand on the verge of defeat. The army of Mengjiang, as if they were never decimated by the revolt of the Mongolian People's Front, have simply continued moving forward until all of their claimed territories have been taken. And this has been a massive hit to the Council, as more and more of Western Mongolia has slowly been slipping out of our control. Perhaps, it is time to end this war.\n\nIf we want to ensure our continued survival after our defeat, a negotiated peace deal would be in our best interests. Should we agree to withdraw from core Mongolian lands, moving to Tuva as our sole base of operations, perhaps Mengjiang would be willing to leave the Council to its own devices."
PRC_Ask_for_a_ceasefire_desc: "In the towns of Tuva and Western Mongolia, people proudly celebrate and wave the flag of the Council, for it has ensured their freedom. At least, it has ensured it for now. After countless skirmishes between the Red Army and enemy forces around the heavily guarded border areas, we still hold our ground. The army of Mengjiang has been unable to penetrate our strong defenses, and has been slowly getting more and more exhausted by the constant struggle it has to go through merely to control its territories.\n\nNow that we have survived against all odds, without losing an inch of land, we could end this conflict. The autonomous government of Mengjiang shall be offered a truce by the People's Revolutionary Council, maintaining the status quo in Western Mongolia. If they are sensible, they will see what this opportunity can bring and grab it."
PRC_Peace_at_least_desc: "The conflict with the Japanese puppet of Mengjiang, that has tried to claim Mongolia for itself, did not prove to be the glorious war of liberation for the country that we had hoped for when it began. The soldiers of the Council, from skilled and experienced officers to fresh recruits, fought bravely, often not for their motherland, but to stay alive. Still, the war has ended.\n\nNow, our rivals have cornered us into an even more difficult position than before, especially after crushing the dream of the Mongolian People's Front. However, we must overcome these hurdles. With what little resources our available to us, and by rallying the citizens of the Council around the cause we fight for, we will soon rise again, as a regional power to challenge the autocrats we are surrounded by."

PRC_Aftermath_of_the_War_desc: "The war has finally ended. Our own Great Patriotic War, the noble fight of our Soviet army against the might of the Co-Prosperity Sphere! While the war was hard, and sacrifices many, we come out of it more mobilized than ever before.\n\nYet, as the old saying goes; after the war, rebuild. And rebuild we must. Despite our soldiers' valiant efforts, our nation has not escaped unscathed, and the war has certainly exposed the many shortcomings of a remnant army in a nomadic land. We lack industry, we lack infrastructure, we lack equipment, and our army leaves much to be desired in terms of training.\n\nBut no matter how much we work on our niche in Mongolia, it must be remembered that our true purpose is our return to the Motherland, and its liberation from turncoats, reactionaries, and Nazi hordes. Za rodinu!"
PRC_Old_Union_Remnants_desc: "We feel, as one of the many who intend to continue the dream that was the Union, it is our job to continue where the Old Union left off. It was under her last leader, Bukharin, that the plan to build up Siberia and Mongolia was introduced. If we are to gain the support of the local population, as well as grow the industrial, agricultural, and infrastructural power of our new home, we must act now to tame the steppe.\n\nThrough programs such as industrialization and the building up of local infrastructure, we believe we can turn Western Mongolia and the Siberian plains into industrial areas. Not only will we be building up infrastructure in a place that has lacked it for so long, we will also create a strong base for future expansion, and be able to support ourselves in the event of conflict with the Central SIberian warlords."
PRC_The_Road_for_Industrialization_desc: "In its thousands of years of human settlement, the steppes and mountains of western Mongolia have not yet seen the wonders of modern industrial life. While Russia, from Moscow to Vladivostok, is rich with industry and manufacturing, Mongolia has yet to be industrialized.\n\nIf we are to bring the Council to greatness and bring back the stability Eurasia enjoyed under Soviet rule, we must first industrialize the steppe. While at first a daunting task, as none have yet succeeded in taming the vast plains, we know the necessity of this work will drive it to its completion.\n\nWhile the Mongolian people are traditionally nomadic, we know they are a strong people who will adjust well to a more sedentary, modern lifestyle. There will be no greater honor than bringing the industrial revolution to the people of Mongolia."
PRC_Build_Up_Civilian_Industry_desc: "One of the largest issues with the Council is its critical lack of significant civilian industry. Civilian industry is the backbone of any country, and we cannot expect to bring back the old Soviet glory without a strong base of factories behind us. We shall embark on a campaign to work on the creation of new centers of light and heavy industry throughout western Mongolia with the goal of making this previously nomadic land into a modern one.\n\nUpon the completion of these projects, more opportunities will open up to the Council. We will be able to manufacture goods that we currently must get from a complex system of only semi-reliable trade among the former Soviet states, many of which we despise the terrible necessity of having to do business with at all.\n\nIt will be these factories that will kickstart the Council's upwards spiral towards greatness! For the Motherland!"
PRC_Reopen_Mining_Fields_desc: "When the Union fell, so did much of their infrastructure and industrial projects the strong Moscow government had been able to prop up with state money to provide economic potential to Tuva, a land known most of all for its lack of significant industrial potential. Now, looking over old Soviet maps and layouts of mines, we have made plans to revitalize these abandoned mining fields and use them to provide for the Council.\n\nUsing Tuvan labor, these mines will provide precious resources for the Council and its armies, resources that will prove useful in inevitable coming conflicts with the enemy forces that surround us. The Tuvan mines can procure useful resources from iron and coal to gold and cobalt, resources that are harder and harder to come by with less and less friendly neighbors.\n\nWhile it may be a difficult process, bringing these mines back up to full capacity and production, the result will surely be worth the process."
PRC_Modern_Construction_Equipments_desc: "As we embark on this industrial crusade, we find ourselves critically underequipped in the way of modernized equipment. While we have many grand plans for the advancement of our nation's infrastructure and industry, these shall never come to fruition without the procurement of large amounts of this construction gear.\n\nUsing various sources from throughout Russia and even Asia, we will spend a considerable amount of money purchasing machines and tools. This will be used to equip our vast construction brigades who will embark on the great taming of the western Mongolian steppes and mountains.\n\nWhile we regret the capitalistic weapons of gaining these vital tools to the program of industrialization, we know that they will go towards the greater expansion to reach our goal of a socialist state."
PRC_The_Tuva_Road_desc: "For centuries the native people of what is now the Council needed no roads but the open steppe, their horses carrying them like ships on a grass sea. Yet as the world moves forward we see the replacement of these maned beasts of burden with pack horses giving way to motor powered machines carrying resources and soldiers. As we introduce these more and more to the Council, we must make the necessary changes to the landscape through the addition of roads and other vital infrastructure.\n\nIn our war one thing we struggle the most with was this lack of infrastructure, clogging up supply lines as dirt roads and paths disappeared or mudded up, with nothing but scant markers marking roads in some areas. Motorized units found the grassland difficult to maneuver in sometimes, asking clearly for better paved infrastructure.\n\nWe will begin a plan to create a vast network of roads throughout our country in order to enhance our states capabilities at war, and at peace."
PRC_Establish_Minimum_Wage_desc: "We must remember that above all else we are still representatives of the Soviet Union and inheritors of her progressive labor practices. It would seem that in the aftermath of her downfall, some of these have slipped from our focus with more pressing matters calling for more drastic measures. However, now that we find ourselves in a stable position once again it is only natural and morally necessary that we return to the promises of Marxism; a state by the workers, for the workers, of the workers!\n\nA minimum wage is to be reintroduced, worker safety prioritized, and the working man exemplified! If we are to maintain our legitimacy as a successor of the Union in the east, then it is time we begin to act like it. While some now scoff their noses at the Old Union, claiming it was weak and authoritarian, but now as the rest of Russia devolves into serfdom we must be the forces of progress, showing Russia the glory of the Union once more."
PRC_Radar_Stations_desc: "The soldiers of the Council may be brave, tenacious, and well meaning, but this means nothing if they are constantly bombarded by Japanese bombers without any warning or notice. It was far too often that whole formations of our men were thrown into disarray by accurate and unexpected air assaults. If we are to avoid this silent death from the skies we must create a network of defensive radar stations to give our men ample warning in order to react.\n\nUsing American technology and domestic copies, we will put together a radar corps that will operate these radar stations to report back to the command the positions of enemy air groups. We expect that casualties would be significantly reduced if we could accurately predict and react to these attacks."
PRC_Decryption_Machines_desc: "Even if we will not in the foreseeable future possess military equipment to parallel the Japanese in quality or in numbers, we may have an advantage even more potent in a future war we would wish to fight. What if, for every move the Japanese made, every soldier they deployed, every operation they planned, we were just as aware as the soldiers commanded.\n\nThis would be a most valuable addition to our arsenal, one that could give us the edge in any fight we came across. It would be even more useful against our Russian foes, who hold our Motherland hostage, as their communication tech is far less advanced.\n\nDecryption machines and their purchase must begin, along with the creation of an advanced Corps of radio operators who will be able to function these machines."
PRC_Agriculture_Mechanization_desc: "The steppe has long been an agricultural beast thought impossible to tame; what little grows there grows poorly, and what flourishes is of no use to the human pallet. This is why the past peoples of the steppe have tamed the wild beasts of the land and rode the deserted plains. Yet we know this is no food strategy for a modern world.\n\nWe must now tame the steppe, for the final time. Through the use of foreign imported agricultural machines and workhorses of steel, we shall till the soil for the first time, providing the people of the Council a stable source of food for the first time in their long history.\n\nThe people shall put their labor to the ground, and from it shall spring the savior of Mongolia, the bringer of food, and the rebirth of the Great Union."
PRC_Work_to_Do_desc: "We have finished through hard work and determination what the whole Union couldn't do; tame the western Mongolian steppe! For that we must rejoice, but understand that our rejoice may be cut short. We are surrounded by cutthroat warlords, Japanese puppets, and barely reliable fellow Soviets.\n\nThese advancements were not the end, only the means to the beginning of a most important process; as we have been looking in, it is now our turn to look out. Yet as we begin the process of turning our work into real change, the two camps that have begun to form come at us with differing ideas as to the future of the Council: are we to do what we have always planned to and leave Mongolia, or stay and build a new Motherland in our new home?\n\nRegardless of the path the Council takes, we know we will have the support of a grateful and modernized nation behind us, and the force of our strong armies!"
PRC_Learn_our_Mistakes_desc: "While our soldiers fought their hardest for a cause just and true, it is without mentioning that we were not the best prepared, equipped, or trained for the War. The Japanese puppets and their near endless resources, their help from the best strategists in East Asia, and support from Indonesia to the Kuril Islands meant that we were outgunned and outmatched.\n\nWe are determined to not repeat the mistakes of the Mengjiang War. In a series of military enhancements, we will build up our forces, establish new tactics, and find new ways to combat our enemies.\n\nYet we also stand at a crossroads. There are some who wonder whether or not, after spending so long so far from our native Russia, if we should really turn our eyes back to Moscow, or instead find the place for socialism in Mongolia? We will be faced with these questions as we develop the doctrine for a new decade."
PRC_Mongolian_Tactics_desc: "This new land calls for new tactics; on the wide Mongolian steppe, we must understand that the main focus of warfare will be on the mass use of infantry in wide sweeping maneuvers, rather than focusing on the mechanized unit. Fast-moving infantry, placed on trucks or even horses, will be the new banes of the Steppe not unlike Genghis Khan from a millennia ago. After all, there's a reason that the Huns, Mongols, Alans, and Manchus all find their nomadic warrior roots in Mongolia.\n\nYet, there is an obvious choice that we are making when we do this. By reorienting our whole army on the lines of warfare in where we currently reside, we are conceding that we no longer have such grandiose dreams of returning to Russia. It is perhaps better that we learn how to build a future for socialism and the Mongolian people in Mongolia. "
PRC_Siberian_Strategy_desc: "If we are to turn our army back to the liberation of our homeland, then we must devise a strategy on how to go about this. While conflict in Mongolia is focused on mobility, in Russia we find that it will be armor and the power of mechanized assault that will win us back the helm of the Motherland!\n\nWith our industry developing, we know there is still a long way to go before the industrial power of the western Mongolian steppe will be able to supply as with armored vehicles, however we know that with time, and other methods of procurement, these will come to us. After all, the Motherland is depending on it! Za rodinu!"
PRC_More_is_Better_desc: "It is a simple maxim, yet an important and true one. There is no quality that will ever be able to truly rival quantity. It is this fact we aim to capitalize on; it does not matter the quality of a soldier, spending thousands to pay for a soldier who will die in a minute of combat is the ultimate waste. Instead, it is a more efficient use of our already limited resources to ensure that in every battle we have the numerical superiority, and use this to overwhelm our foes.\n\nOur soldiers are strong in quantity, and their tenacity in combat matches any army's. It is only how we will use it; will it be in support of a free Russia, or to keep the scourge of Japanese fascism from Mongolia, and create a Mongolia for Mongols?"
PRC_Cavalry_Divisions_desc: "In the creation of an army to rule the steppes, we must harkon back to the force that has dominated these steppes for millenia on millenia; the horse. It is on the horse that the Mongolian people are born, a fact that must always be remembered when creating an army of Mongolia, for Mongolia. The Japanese army, while large, is not fit to fight on the open plains; their men simply aren't mobile enough, and the truck will never be able to truly replace a horse on the grassland.\n\nWe shall create divisions of mounted infantry, that will use these horses to maneuver around the battlefield in order to gain positional superiority over the enemy. The cumbersome armored formations on the steppe will find that the tank will be unable to compete with the natural speed of the stallion."
PRC_Army_of_the_Steppes_desc: "The Army's next step in transitioning to a fully mobile force will be to commence large-scale exercises on the Steppes themselves, testing the limits of its operational speed and capacity to strike. War-games are only easy to organize on paper - in reality we will have to build entire mock operational structures to simulate hostiles for us to attack.\n\nEven so, these exercises will formally demarcate our operational readiness and prove that we have truly become capable of the task of retaking Mongolia. And when the Steppes are ours, well, all under Heaven will follow."
PRC_Industry_of_War_desc: "Modern war is like no war ever seen before. Men, soldiers, are no longer the most important force on the battlefield. It is the huge metal machines that dominate, these beasts that fly or roll. These jet fighters, these main battle tanks, these are what will win us the day. There is no hope in the world for an army that is not equipped with the time.\n\nThese machines do not come from nowhere, they are not as easily replaceable as a soldier. No, they require a vast industrial infrastructure to maintain them. Our goal is simple: the attainment and utmost use of this infrastructure to maintain a modern force, for the Motherland."
PRC_Air_Cavalry_Divisions_desc: "For millennia it has been the horse that has dominated the steppe, as the horse was the fastest way of getting a man from point A to point B that anyone knew. But, that fact has changed, and now there is one faster way, a better way, a more effective way to make use of mobility in this terrain: the helicopter.\n\nWe must reorganize our divisions of old horses with their modern counterparts. By using the helicopter to modernize our forces we believe we will have a distinct advantage over any other force near us; its ability to quickly transport forces over vast distances will allow us to orchestrate surrounding maneuvers and dominate the steppe."
PRC_Spearhead_of_the_Red_Army_desc: "What few tanks our armies have are old, decrepit, and we have so few spare parts that a hard hit with a hammer could mean the effective destruction of the tank. If these are truly going to be the Vanguard of our revolutionary front we will have to undergo extensive modernizations.\n\nThe inclusion of a strong, modern, well-equipped tank force in the People's Revolutionary Council's Red Army would put us above the poorly armed factions of reactionaries, traitors, and puppets that surround us. Their infantry would have no answer to a fleet of mechanical landships swarming over the steppe in an iron wave.\n\nThe revolution, yet unfinished, will see its glory realized from the tip of a 105mm cannon on the front of a steel beast!"
PRC_Modernize_the_Army_desc: "Much of our army, while trained and well organized, still utilizes outdated equipment. This equipment must be replaced if we are to be of any relevance in regional affairs. The armies of our foes to the east are weakly armed with Japanese surplus, spare the Japanese themselves. Those to our north use equipment that some grandfathers used to fight the losing war during the Great Patriotic War. A modern army would have no equals in the tundra or in the steppe; we would be the dominant local force.\n\nThis modernization will bring our Red Army back to its former height as the strongest and most motivated of modern forces. There is no way towards a liberated Russia, or a liberated Mongolia, without a modern army capable of bringing that dream to fruition."
PRC_Relax_Training_Standards_desc: "Within the People's Revolutionary Council there exists a finite supply of men who could serve in our army; with every increasing standard, our pool of soldiers decreases as such. While strong, well-trained soldiers should continue to be the ideal soldier of the People's Revolutionary Council, we understand the necessity that calls for us to further relax the training regimen in exchange for an army that can more closely match, or even exceed, that of our neighbors armies.\n\nIt is understood that, while this may give us more soldiers, this will lead to a general decrease in the average individual soldier's combat abilities, one that may never be recovered. But we know that no war may be won without sacrifice, and no decision is without consequences. We hope that every choice is a kilometer closer to the final victory."
PRC_Mantain_Proffesional_Army_desc: "An army of professional volunteers and well-trained conscripts is an army that will always fight to the best of its ability. In Asia and the lands of Siberian Russia there exists a dearth of these professional armies; possessing one will give us a huge advantage in the ways of making war.\n\nTo our east stands the mercenary and conscript armies of Japanese Mongolia, only getting help from the Japanese in their direst of situations. To our north and west the squabbling reactionary warlords claw at each other, too focused on their petty enemies to plan beyond. A professional army will make quick worth of these foes.\n\nAs we venture back to our native lands, the well-trained and professional troops of our Front shall lead the way!"
PRC_Aggressive_Doctrine_desc: "An old saying goes: the best defense is a strong offense. It is this key idea that we will use as our compass navigating the complex political situation we find ourselves in in the Siberian and Mongolian theatres. We must always keep the enemy on the backfoot; giving them enough time to react will surely see our less industrially strong and significantly less well equipped army defeated in battle.\n\nOur new main enemies, the Japanese, outdo us in every category. Their army is larger, their tanks are newer, their planes are faster, and their puppets are numerous. But in any possible winning scenario, we have one key advantage, the element of surprise.\n\nWe must always be prepared to use this, for it is our hope!"
PRC_Prioritize_Defense_desc: "Within the Council there exists a finite supply of men who could serve in our army; with every increasing standard, our pool of soldiers decreases as such. While strong, well-trained soldiers should continue to be the ideal soldier, we understand the necessity that calls for us to further relax the training regimen in exchange for an army that can more closely match, or even exceed, that of our neighbors armies.\n\nIt is understood that, while this may give us more soldiers, this will lead to a general decrease in the average individual soldier's combat abilities, one that may never be recovered. But we know that no war may be won without sacrifice, and no decision is without consequences. We hope that every choice is a kilometer closer to the final victory."
PRC_Decide_Our_Future_desc: "As our nation stumbles into modernity and our army gears itself for one last move into the dark, we face a final choice. The Mongolians and the Russians have shared uneasy dominion over our Politburo and Army respectively, mutually distrustful but with no option other than collaboration. This is no longer the case.\n\nWe must decide once and for all who will lead the fledgeling nation. Will the Soviet we are building be Russian-dominated, oriented towards the retaking of the past? Or a Mongolian one, oriented towards the future and the steppes? History faces us. We must answer it."

PRC_Red_Spring_desc: "No longer shall the People's Revolutionary Council lie as an unremarkable collection of scattered brigades and divisions in the Altai mountains. Surrounded by hostile warlords on the one side and a dangerous Japanese satellite to the other, we must always keep an eye out for threats and armies gathering on our border, but expansion to elsewhere in Central Siberia has been unanimously agreed to by Russian and Mongolian generals alike. Thus, crossing the mountain passes that we have used as our defenses for so long, the wars of reunification will begin, from a candidate that many people might consider unlikely. We must prove them wrong.\n\nIt is time for the soldiers of the Red Army to return to their homelands in the most obvious way possible; by fighting their way there."
PRC_Deal_with_the_Old_Believers_desc: "The Old Believers can trace their origins to the 17th century, when just like many other times in the history of Christianity, their faith divided its followers. Through the years, they maintained their identity and their religious denomination, even into the 20th century. Now, in the lands of Oyrotia, just to the west of the Council, their faith lives on through the deal they, exiled there from the Soviet Union, have made with the locals.\n\nWhat our leadership has realized is that every war we wage against our brothers for ideology or power, even if it gives us more land, is a strain on the economy and military of the country. Many believe that peacefully bringing Oyrotia into the fold is in fact possible, as long as we clearly guarantee them rights and freedom. A promise to keep the liberty of the Old Believers, and respect their religion, could convince them that joining us is their best option."
PRC_March_to_Oyrotia_desc: "Oyrotia has been the site of a most unlikely alliance, that between the Old Believers scattered in Russia but concentrated in the Altai region, and the Burkhanist locals. Even though it is a great story of the people coming together in the fierce Russian environment, the Council has no tolerance of such warlord states; this is especially true when they are built on an alliance of religious people and Altaic nationalists. It will take no time for the Far Eastern Red Army to march westwards, in the direction of Oyrotia, and subdue it once and for all. Lacking an army force as large and experienced as we do, all resistance the Old Believers will have to offer is likely to be in the form of disorganized militia units. All estimates of our experts agree that this first step in our expansion will take a very short time."
PRC_Integrate_the_Administration_desc: "The Council has proven itself to be a free and welcoming state, as even the religious Old Believers have joined their comrades in the east for the struggle in reuniting the Motherland. We should not let the chance presented by this peaceful annexation, which is to swiftly and effectively integrate Oyrotia, to go by.\n\nIn its years of existence, the fledgling nation developed quite an effective system of governance and administration, which was helped by the fact that it was rarely involved in exhausting conflicts. As we establish our authority over Oyrotia, it will be extremely useful to maintain the local administration, that is set up and experienced, in its old place."
PRC_Persecute_the_Believers_desc: "The Old Believers, who we have conquered with ease, are opposed to everything we stand for, in a way. While we believe in many of the socialist beliefs which men have fought for since the Revolution, the Oyrotians don't. Their most outrageous defiance of our ideology is religion, something that has been magnified by the independence and power the Believers gained. We cannot let them roam the Council and spreading this faith, and as such, they must be persecuted much like any other fanatic Christian group. Those who do not choose to assimilate to the new society will have to be persecuted and isolated from others until they learn to make the right choices."
PRC_End_with_Anarchy_desc: "The Black Army has been a consequence of the destructive Siberian War, as a backlash against the Supreme Soviet of Yagoda. Their belief, to our knowledge being different from anywhere else in Russia, is militarized anarchism, where the communes enjoy their freedom but the disadvantages and chaos of this system are compensated through a powerful army. As much as the Council appreciates freedom, we cannot let this radically different system of government, or rather the lack of it, continue in Tulun and its surroundings. It is time to put an end to the Black Army, by invading it from our bases in Tuva using a strong military offensive."
PRC_Restore_Order_desc: "The anarchist army to our north has finally been brought under our heel, bar a few holdouts and bandits, something typical for this country nowadays. Still, we hold all strategic points that matter: the cities, the railways, and the roads, and that can be enough to assert our control. The Council will begin a program of systematic stabilization and cracking down on "enemies of the state", and with the passage of time, the noose we've tied around the conquered territories will make sure that they are properly integrated and stabilized. Only once that is done can we continue the long road to reunification."
PRC_Crush_the_Communes_desc: "The concept of the communes, the separate settlements in the sparse lands of Siberia that maintain their control over themselves in a democratic fashion, is one of the deep roots of the ideology of anarchism and the Siberian Black Army. With the ultimate defeat of them, the communes must be crushed as well.\n\nThe process of eliminating this sentiment of local power and autonomy is simple, and it is to take the power away from them. The systems used by the anarchists will end, and a typical socialist administration will be imposed, just as in the rest of the Council's territories. Of course, the Red Army will be present in every step of the process, to ensure it goes smoothly and with no problems whatsoever."
PRC_Ruriks_Madness_desc: "The city of Kemerovo, in the final stages of the Siberian War, fell in the hands of General Krylov, who seems to us as if he has gone insane. Claiming to be the sole monarch and ruler of Russia, Rurik the Second, he has established a fiefdom of him with the help of the army.\n\nThis is sheer madness! Krylov has not only dared to challenge the authority of the nation, but he has claimed a position that he could never dream of rightfully getting. He shall get the same treatment as the Romanovs, and that is no compromise with the people until unconditional surrender. We have already begun the path to reunification by force, and it cannot be stopped down. "Rurik" will be brought down by the Red Army."
PRC_Dismantle_the_Kingdom_desc: "With our army having the experience from the first battles of reunification, and with it having a amassed on the frontier between the Council and Kemerovo, it is time to strike. The principality General Krylov has built in the city that forms one of the many crucial links of the Trans-Siberian Railway will not last for much longer.\n\nThe preparations made by our army have been judged adequate, and we will almost certainly overwhelm whatever army Kemerovo possesses. Through the joint effort of Mongolians and Russians, we will manage to defeat yet another enemy in our way of the reclamation of our lands."
PRC_The_Royal_Family_Fate_desc: "When General Krylov, having finally broke after seeing the troubles Russia and himself suffered for so long, declared himself as Rurik II, his family followed him. Krylov's wife, as well as his children, had faith in his endeavours and lived in comfort in Kemerovo for years, these comforts funded by the loot of Rurik's army. Currently, they are no longer the relatives of the great ruler of the city, for he is king no more, and we must make up our minds on what we will do with them. The options are simple: we could force them into exile, sending them outside of our controlled territories and setting them free, or we could do what some of our generals think is best, and follow the footsteps of the first Bolshevik revolutionaries in 1918: that is to simply execute them."
PRC_Integrate_Crownlands_desc: "What other generals found impossible to do in the chaos of Central Siberia, we have accomplished. The fiefdom of General Krylov has fallen, and the treacherous madman is under our custody. In the town of Kemerovo, one can see the troops of the Council patrolling every major street to maintain order and hunt down any remaining bandits and insurgents. This process continues, but if we want to ensure a good life for the people of our occupied territories, martial law cannot last long. By extending our administration to these lands and pacifying them, they can become integral parts of our state and allow us to continue our quest to reunify Siberia."
PRC_The_Northern_Populists_desc: "Central Siberia is a land where many generals have found the opportunity to be something more than just officers, creating separate warlord states based on their beliefs and their goals. While we have shown our willingness to defeat them, some still resist, and a prime example of this is Nikolai Andreev. He has built his own state in Krasnoyarsk, a "democracy protected by the army", and has amassed popular support by simply promising to fulfill the promises of the people ... at some point. Of course, this oligarchy cannot stand, and it is the duty of the Council to take action and wrestle control of Krasnoyarsk. As we grow in size, power and influence, the swift invasion and defeat of the populist general to our north shall be an easy accomplishment."
PRC_Strike_Krasnoyarsk_desc: "The fiefdom of Nikolai Andreev has struggled to survive in the sliver of land it occupies between the fanatical Black Army and the insane monarchists of Kemerovo in the few years it has existed, starting from the end of Andreev's allegiance to the Central Siberian Republic and ending now. We have made our goal clear, and that goal is nothing less than completing the unification of Central Siberia under the banner of the Council, with no compromises and no negotiations.\n\nUnfortunately for Krasnoyarsk, it stands in the way of this noble goal. As such, with the support of the workers and the peasants, we will make our move, and take aggressive action against the populists. Should we succeed in this process of liberation, then that will mean one less enemy left to challenge our power."
PRC_Offer_Amnesty_desc: "Krasnoyarsk has often been called "the land of the opportunists", as most of its leaders and oligarchs do not have any strong belief in a certain ideology, but simply grabbed the chance to become leaders and earn the support of the people. It is this lack of ideology that also means many in the military and administration are not fanatics, and thus have a chance of defecting to our side if they see that the war favors the Council. A perfect way to encourage this exact behaviour is by promising complete amnesty to any member of the enemy's government and military that decides to make this choice. After all, if they truly wish to follow the wishes of the people, then it is only logical they side with the state of socialism and liberty we have created."
PRC_Destroy_the_Military_Remnants_desc: "The army of Krasnoyarsk was a powerful and skillful military force, but seeing as they devoted themselves to the ideals of General Nikolai Andreev, we have no choice but to purge them.\n\nBelieving in the ideals of democracy they had never seen accomplished, few soldiers of Andreev made the right choice to defend to the Council as it invaded. The rest were either killed in the battles, or interned in our prisoner of war camps. While the normal soldiers may be released or conscripted, the higher-ranking officers and generals all played a role in the creation of the Krasnoyarsk clique, and will either be imprisoned or, in a few cases, executed. Finally, we must seek to end the role the military played in the society of Krasnoyarsk as well, and that will be a lengthy process, as we terminate or reorganize many of the institutions that were plagued with army interference. The people of the city will finally enjoy true freedom."
PRC_Border_Fortifications_desc: "Great enemies, from the anarchist army to the Madman of Kemerovo, have fallen as we continue to expand. A large swath of land stretching across Siberia is now occupied by the People's Revolutionary Council, as opposed to what little ground we used to hold before we began our path of liberation. As we expand, though, we must also consider defensive measures. Specifically, much of the High Command has stated they wish for the construction of fortifications along our western frontier, where we face the biggest threats and where preparations for war are absolutely needed. This defensive line will be a good use of our limited military budget, for we will be able to safely keep our lands, with no unnecessary sacrifices of men required. The best engineers and military experts will thus be given the task of completing this construction, for the good of the Council."
PRC_Prepare_our_Troops_desc: "A great step forward in achieving the reclamation of Central Siberia has been completed, and we must prepare for the next outburst of action against the giants we now have to face. Our army, while it is certainly well-equipped and trained, will have to be prepared for a new environment and a new method of warfare, that of more expansive and more intense battles.\n\nNew manuals, military exercises and wargames are being prepared by the Council's High Command, solely for the purpose of helping the army adjust to the new situation we find ourselves in. This effort must be encouraged if we want to excel on the battlefield when the battles start again."
PRC_The_Last_Fight_desc: "It is time to give everything we have in the final phase of defeating our regional enemies, the last remnants of the Central Siberian Republic that must be erased at all costs.\n\nThe People's Revolutionary Council has proven itself to be the strongest competitor in the region, defeating anyone who has stood in its way. Only one last push remains to be made, and that is the great attack westwards. Using the power we have accumulated from our previous conquests, the thrust will have to be supported by everything we have at our disposal. It is our hope that, in the streets of Tomsk and Novosibirsk, the people will soon have a chance to come out and celebrate their liberation, proudly waving the flag of the Council.\n\nOur military, from its troubled beginnings and its struggle for survival, is now the greatest tool we have for the liberation of the people, and the next phase of this liberation begins now."
PRC_Crush_the_Artists_Republic_desc: "Tomsk was born out of the ashes of the old Central Siberian Republic. As the Siberian War stretched the country to its absolute limit, it collapsed, and what remained of it established itself in Tomsk. It was ruled by Pasternak and his successors for a long time, and it made itself known by being a state of intellectuals, from poets to composers to scientists. Now, they must all suffer due to the poor choice they made.\n\nThe remnants of the old republic will be crushed with no mercy, and its leaders will be dealt with. The proud army of the Council has made the right preparations, and stands on the unofficial border, ready to receive orders. Once considered one of the two giants of Central Siberia, Tomsk will crumble in front of the Council, which will be ready to take its position."
PRC_Overrun_Tomsk_desc: "Tomsk is not a densely populated warlord state, nor a heavily defended one, despite the power of the local militia that it has amassed for its defense. In front of these disorganized militia units, our own army of the Far Eastern Military District is much stronger. For that reason, despite the advantages the enemy may have in fields such as industry, the Council's generals believe in a fast charge against Tomsk that will achieve their final elimination. By making our attack from all sides and overwhelming them with professional tactics, it is possible to overrun Tomsk, and win this war within a surprisingly small amount of time. The plan of a quick victory is certainly ambitious, yet it is within the realm of possibility, and we can implement it."
PRC_Spread_Political_Division_desc: "The divisions and rifts between the competing political groups in Tomsk could easily be used to the Council's advantage. The factions that strive for dominance are many, and have inspiring names, like "Humanists" and "Bastillards", but what we truly care about is exploiting them for our own purposes.\n\nAs we continue our invasion, penetrating deeper into Tomsk's lands and defeating their armies, we can spark discontent and wariness in the internal affairs of our enemy, using secret deals, bribes and channels to influence them. It is enough to stage protests or clashes, or back anti-war sentiment, to hopefully send the democrats into a spiral of self-destruction. As they struggle to control the situation within their own zone, our campaign of liberation will be much easier."
PRC_Incorpore_Friendly_Elements_desc: "The Central Siberian Republic, from its infancy to its isolation until its final demise, has been a diverse and vibrant democracy of the bourgeoisie. Liberals, conservatives, oligarchs and more all played some role in the politics of the Siberian state, with varying popularity and clout as time went on. Perhaps we could use this to our advantage, since our contact with Tomsk has shown that there are, in fact, some political movements and organizations that lean to the left and are supportive of socialism.\n\nIt would be prudent, in order to stabilize the lands far in the north, to approach these groups and make them an offer, which is to incorporate them into our government and utilize their support. If they accept, then things will be significantly easier for us, but if they refuse, they will have the same fate as all the other movements in Tomsk."
PRC_Purge_Them_All_desc: "Every political party and movement in Tomsk have proven themselves unreliable, as they all joined together in defense of their hopeless dream, that of a surviving republic. Few groups made the right choice - defecting to the Council when they had the chance to - and so we are left with no choice but to disband the rest.\n\nThe campaign for the destruction of the bourgeoisie and aristocratic foundations Tomsk had been built upon will be encouraged by our regime and carried out steadily and with caution. We must make sure to disband the old order that governed the city, ending the factions that used to dominate it and making sure their leaders do not pose a threat anymore. Only when that has succeeded can we claim that the Republic has, in fact, fallen forever."
PRC_Hunt_Down_the_Siberian_Falcon_desc: "Novosibirsk made itself known in Siberia by its sheer power and influence. With an amount of population, industry and natural resources to use greater than most warlords, it is only logical that it grew to become a strong fighting force, and one that could challenge the CSR's authority. All the resources that Alexander Pokryshkin, the notorious Siberian Falcon, has in his possession are crucial to our cause and must be seized for the good of the Motherland.\n\nAs they are one of the most formidable forces we have to face in our battle of reunification, we must use everything we've got on the oligarchs of Novosibirsk. They must be crushed under the heel of the People's Revolutionary Council."
PRC_Infiltrate_Their_Army_desc: "The army of Novosibirsk can definitely be considered strong and able to defend its ideals, and that is precisely why we must weaken it. What makes it powerful, aside from its numbers and its flawless structure, is its unity, and we can attempt to end or, at the very least, negate all of these advantages.\n\nFirstly, if we manage to infiltrate the Novosibirsk military with our own men, we will be able to extract useful information and spy on them, discovering their composition, tactics and plans. Additionally, the ideology of socialism that the People's Revolutionary Council follows can easily appeal to the common worker or soldier, and the same is true for the troops of the Siberian Falcon's army. With spies in it, we can spark discontent and mutiny, increasing our chances of complete victory."
PRC_Sabotage_Supply_Lines_desc: "The lines our enemy uses to funnel its troops and supplies to the frontline that needs them are well-known, and even if they are not, they are not terribly hard to discover in the sparse Siberian lands. As every army is aware of, supply lines are the key behind the scenes to fighting a war, and we can target them to sabotage the enemy. Special agents, friendly rebels, or other people associated with us, can begin clandestine operations to disrupt these lines. There are many methods to do this, from the classic bombing of a road or railway, to bandit attacks, to even bombing raids. While the latter may be difficult, as the Siberian Falcon is known for his dedication to a powerful air force, we must examine every possibility and use everything we have in our great war."
PRC_The_Siberian_Air_Fleet_desc: "Novosibirsk was notorious for its powerful air force since its creation in the late stages of the Siberian War. It is obvious that, having a pilot as its supreme leader, a disproportionate amount of funds was poured into forming air wings and producing planes. Now, we can use that to our advantage.\n\nOf course, the Council was never particularly keen on producing its own air force, at most maintaining a squadron of outdated and barely functional aircraft from the days of the Great Patriotic War. Now, with the Novosibirsk air fleet captured and some of their crews even defecting to us, it is the perfect opportunity to use our new spoils of war to form a barebones branch of the military dedicated to airpower. As we head into the unification of Central Siberia, it could become increasingly useful."
PRC_Liberation_of_Siberia_desc: "After years of hard work for our Motherland, Central Siberia has been unified. No longer will it be divided between different generals, despots and populists, squabbling over trivial matters and ideology, or simply over their own prestige. From the mountains of Tuva and Mongolia, the one true regime, the People's Revolutionary Council, has come to the rescue of this region that is troubled ever since the collapse of the Union, sweeping any enemies we find on our way northwards. Now, with the power of the remnants of the Red Army, Central Siberia is finally under one banner again. All that remains now is for the final future of Central Siberia to be decided by its leaders and the people; however, with dangerous enemies on our east and west, we won't stay idle."

PRC_MIL_Securing_Far_East_desc: "The Far East is incredibly diverse, culturally and ideologically. To be united our new lands must be integrated into our administration, using local governors and leftover communist officials. The locals will become accustomed to our new rule and to the Red Army. All resistance will be met with the utmost force."
PRC_MIL_The_Soviet_Navy_desc: "We now have sea access, giving us a necessary advantage. We must start developing a navy worthy of the old Russia, a new Pacific Fleet that will rule the waves. New ship designs will need to be adopted and dockyards constructed to create a fully functioning Red Navy, just as the Soviet Union had decades before"
PRC_MIL_Open_New_Doors_desc: "Now that we have acquired access to the Pacific Ocean, we have acquired a number of new opportunities both for trade and for diplomacy. To the east lies the shining cities of the United States, full of both riches and hatred for the Reich and Sphere. To the south lies the industrious states of Asia, many of which are still staunchly opposed to the Sphere and are desperate for allies to protect them from the schemes of the greater powers. Both of these serve as a great chance for us to secure our position through ties to the rest of the world and defend against the predations of the Sphere and Reich."
PRC_MIL_Rebuild_The_Cities_desc: "Much of the Far East was left devastated by the wars that occurred throughout the region, such as the Siberian War or the petty conflicts between warlords shortly after, leaving the cities damaged and to a certain extent depopulated. This, in turn, critically weakened the economy of the region and left far too many in poverty, which is now our problem to solve. To undo some of the damage we will repair the cities and encourage people to move back into them, while also investing in the region to create, if not prosperity, then at least the normality there once was before all the fighting."
PRC_MIL_Move_Our_Troops_desc: "We have now secured the Far East. With this in mind, we have forces to spare, and must focus upon our greatest threat. That threat is not the fascist empire of the Sphere, nor the partisans that still occasionally attack from the vast tundra of Siberia. Those enemies of the true successors of the Soviet Union would be dealt with in due time, but currently we must look west. Western Russia has likewise been united under a Russian warlord, and while they have lots of manpower, they have been scarred by the terror bombings of the Huns.\n\nWe can't let down our guard, regardless of how much damage those bombers did. We must move the vast majority of our forces to our western border, and prepare for a bloody unification. Even if our western counterparts intend for a peaceful resolution to this dark age, we must not show weakness. Not when peace is so close at hand."
PRC_MIL_Invite_Their_Scientists_desc: "Despite the relatively low population and high poverty of the region, there were a number of talented young scientists working for the Far Eastern states. Now that we have taken control of the region, their future careers are in limbo, having no ties to our state. This is a mistake that we must immediately correct, for we are not in the sort of position where we can afford to let skilled researchers slip out of our hands. As such, we will invite them to come work for our government and innovate on our behalf, closing the technological gap with the rest of the world and improving our reputation in one action."
PRC_MIL_Looking_Into_The_West_desc: "Unification is close at hand. Only two contenders remain, and the next few months will decide the fate of all of Russia. Our men have fought for a long time, and they may be tired, but we must prepare for one more battle. Nobody wants this to end in bloodshed, and our diplomats are trying their hardest to achieve a peaceful resolution. However, we can't guarantee our western neighbors intentions, and both of our militaries have mobilized against each other. If either of our two nations attempts a surprise offensive, the other will be prepared.\n\nLet us hope that Russia will be reunited by pen and paper, rather than blood and steel."
PRC_MIL_Reallocate_Our_Forts_desc: "Our nation is covered in defensive lines, fortifications, and bunkers. These fortifications were meant to be used against foes that no longer exist. It's a complete waste, and these resources would be far more effective elsewhere.\n\nThe only border that needs defending is our western border. The fate of Russia rests upon what happens at that border, and we can't afford to leave that border undefended in such a crucial time. As such, we are ordering the immediate dismantlement of these archaic, useless fortifications. Following this dismantlement, we are also ordering the immediate construction of fortifications along the West Russian border. If the unifier of Western Russia attempts to strike against us, they shall find their offensive shattered by impenetrable defenses."
PRC_MIL_Port_Modernization_Program_desc: "Although impressive ports, once travelled to by ships from around the world, line the coasts of Amur and Magadan, they have lost most of their past glory. This is largely due to their outdated technology, and equipment in dire need of repair, which has discouraged overseas trade. By modernizing the ports to have the latest and finest equipment and technology we can afford, as well as improving upon their original design, we can once again encourage trade to come in from Shanghai to San Francisco, and bring prosperity to the people of the Far Eastern ports."
PRC_MIL_Roads_Through_The_Wastes_desc: "The Far East is a very disconnected place difficult for a central government to properly manage, with the roads ruined by disrepair and the infrastructure destroyed by conflict. Now that we control the region, it is our responsibility to repair the damage and restore everything to working order. In addition to that, we will build new highways to connect the major cities and encourage internal trade, thereby enriching the people and securing our control of the land. With these aims accomplished, we might create a Siberia that thrives even more than before the war."
PRC_MIL_The_Pacific_Route_desc: "The time has come to finally put the newly acquired Pacific ports to good use. Though trade has long existed with Asia and the Americas through the Pacific coast, it was severely impacted by the war and the resulting collapse of the Union, and then further limited by the Siberian War. Restoring these past trade links could only be to our benefit, and could help us to achieve closer relations with the United States and unaligned Asian countries. We should therefore immediately dispatch diplomats to meet with these governments and reach agreements with them to encourage Pacific trade to reach our ports."
PRC_MIL_The_Siberian_Trains_desc: "The Trans-Siberian Railway is a vital artery of our state, yet over the past two decades it has fallen into a state of dangerous disrepair which threatens our very ability to manage the territory we control. We must set about repairing it without delay to prevent this threat, and keep the flow of trade going within our state. It would also be wise to, as we repair the railway, modernize it, as it has become relatively limited in its capabilities when compared to other large railways due to the outdated technology it uses, and make it even more efficient than it was before the Union collapsed."
PRC_MIL_The_Workers_Example_desc: "The driving force of our cause, the foundation of all communist ideals, is the example set by the common worker and the strong belief in the righteousness of it. All people must work according to their ability, to provide for each according to their needs. This ideal is what motivates us to labor, to fight, to survive, in hopes of one day reaching a better, more equal world than the one we currently live in. Our state will continue to be a champion of this ideal on behalf of workers around the world, and those at home."
PRC_MIL_A_Renewed_Union_desc: "At long last, we are ready. The roads and cities have been thoroughly repaired and employment found for the impoverished, diplomatic relations have been opened up around the world with a wide variety of governments, our ports, railways, and highways have been rebuilt and greatly modernized to better connect even the remotest areas of our territory, and innovation in scientific fields is proceeding even more quickly than before. Not only that, we have moved our soldiers and fortresses to our western border, to protect ourselves against any incursions. We are ready to reunite Russia, regain what has been lost, and return home."

PRC_civilian: "The Novosibirsk Conference has Ended"
PRC_military: "The Novosibirsk Conference has Ended"

PRC_Secure_our_Position_desc: "After years of fighting we have accomplished something that once seemed impossible. Our enemies lie vanquished and the Red Army is now the uncontested master of Central Siberia. With our external threats disposed of, we now have time to turn inward and solidify our control. Though the squabbling strongmen and bourgeoisie liberals have been cast from their thrones, their supporters are still as numerous as they are dangerous. We must embark on a campaign of regional consolidation and pacification.\n\nAnother issue of even greater importance must be settled. With much of the old Union now under our control once more, many in the administration are wondering whether the time for military rule is finally coming to an end. The question of a restored revolutionary civilian government must be answered soon, before it has time to form fractures within our leadership that are too deep to repair."
PRC_The_Krasnoyarsk_Conference_desc: "A conference has been called to settle the question of establishing a civilian government in central Siberia. From across our territory generals, bureaucrats, and loyal revolutionaries of all stripes are making their way to the city of Krasnoyarsk where they will each present their arguments and do their damndest to see their plans for the future of the Union enacted.\n\nFor the most part the bureaucrats are the strongest supporters of restoring civilian control while the generals are in favor of maintaining their hold for the time being, though there are exceptions to this rule. Some in the administration side with the military, fearing that it is too early for the army to relinquish its emergency powers safely, and a few generals have argued that the army would be a much more capable force if it was not constantly occupied with running the state. All of these matters will be settled in Krasnoyarsk."
PRC_A_Way_Of_Hope_desc: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference is quickly approaching, and those who wish for a restored civilian government are wasting no time preparing. The fate of the People's Revolutionary Council will be decided in Krasnoyarsk, and despite the promises of the generals, this may be the last chance for a Union not run by its army. The people of Central Siberia are watching the proceedings anxiously, many hoping they might finally see a restoration of the old Soviet government.\n\nThe generals for the most part remain opposed despite popular support for strengthened civilian control. Many have voiced their concerns over a weakening of the state at a time when the Union remains shattered and we are still surrounded by enemies. Their arguments are persuasive to many in the halls of power, and winning out over them will require much work. The bureaucrats can only hope they still have enough time."
PRC_Defenders_Of_The_Union_desc: "As the conference draws near, it is clear that the supporters of the military government will not concede their power without at least making a case for their continued control over the Council. The debates will be fierce and the advocates for civilian control will argue passionately, but the risk is too great. The Union is still fragmented, divided by petty warlords and rival governments consolidating their hold over greater amounts of territory by the day.\n\nThe generals remain committed to eventually implementing a civilian government once Russia is whole again, but the supporters of early restoration are not satisfied by their promises. The Red Army will have to work overtime in the coming months to gain the support of the civilians if it is to triumph in the looming war of words. Failure in this matter would see us destroyed not from without, but within"
PRC_Deal_With_Officers_desc: "Most figures of prominence in the Red Army have announced they will accept the implementation of the new government should the bureaucrats win out, but a few officers still refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Krasnoyarsk Conference. These men are not high ranking members of the military command, but they are not insignificant either. In their current positions they could severely obstruct the progress of a potential government they would refuse to acknowledge. Fortunately, they do not need to remain in their current positions.\n\nUnder the guise of administrative reshuffling, most of the disloyal officers can be relegated to obscurity, sent to oversee tiny garrisons in villages north of the Arctic Circle. The few who cannot be sent away will be made to understand one thing: disobeying the government is treason, and treason carries only one punishment in the Soviet Union."
PRC_Establish_A_Civilian_Goverment_desc: "The civilian government of the Soviet Union does currently exist, but in a withered form. The Red Army holds most of the power while the government it should answer to is a glorified bureaucracy. However, withered as it may be, it is not totally powerless. Through careful use of what powers they have been granted, the supporters of the civilian government can begin to entrench their position and show they are not a force to be trifled with. This measured demonstration of power will show the people that the Red Army generals, heroic patriots that they are, are not invincible, and the bureaucrats are ready for the task of leadership.\n\nIn the future this will be remembered as the first step on the road to the restoration of the Soviet Union. After years of fighting, a noble clique of revolutionary generals reclaimed the core of their motherland and the rightful government they fought for reasserted itself as the vanguard of the Revolution. Now all that is left to do is formalize the government's power in Krasnoyarsk, and secure our rule once and for all!"
PRC_Deal_With_The_Administration_desc: "The old administrators who have been around since the fall of the Soviet Union have always been the strongest supporters of a restored civilian government, and the results of the Krasnoyarsk conference have left them far from happy. Already the army is getting reports of conspiracies and obstructionist behavior. Despite the best efforts of the generals to win them over, many in the old guard refuse to see reason. Something must be done.\n\nSome of the hardline militarists have called for a purge, but most consider that to be too excessive. Instead, the bureaucrats will see their own mechanisms used against them. They will be reassigned to positions of minor importance where they could not obstruct the army if they tried. Only a few of the most entrenched figures must be dealt with in a more permanent fashion, and such methods are not new to our government."
PRC_Strength_Military_Institutions_desc: "The Red Army has taken us far, and there is no reason to doubt they cannot take us farther still. The desire for civilian control is understandable, but this is no time for infighting and factionalism. We must stand behind the military and support it with every resource we have. It has been decided that the military government will continue until Russia is reunified, so we will ensure that government is as strong and efficient as possible.\n\nRed Army officers will be posted in oversight positions in every government office and agency. Civilian administrators will continue to work at their posts, but under the clear understanding that they serve at the behest of the army. The government and the military will be fused into one monolithic entity, responsible for protecting the people, reclaiming the Union, and advancing the revolutionary cause."
PRC_Talk_To_The_Generals_desc: "With the officers who refuse to accept the possibility of civilian rule dealt with, we can now turn to their superiors. None of the generals have been so bold as to openly reject our hypothetical authority, but it is clear that many of them would prefer to continue calling the shots. Luckily, most of the generals are more reasonable than their subordinates, and it is likely we will be able to reach an understanding if the bureaucrats triumph.\n\nGenerals with known militarist ambitions will be summoned to the capitol for a series of private meetings. We will make it clear to them that even if they should lose power, the Red Army will still play a vital role in the government. Throw in a few reminders that we are all fighting for the same Soviet ideals and the restoration of the Union and they will be like putty in our hands. Any who refuse to come around will simply have to face the consequences of their decisions."
PRC_Decide_Power_Balance_desc: "With the civilian government preparing to take control there will soon be a clear separation between the military and the government giving it orders. The only question that remains is where that separation will be.\n\nWith the Red Army playing such a vital role in the reconquest of Central Siberia, many in the new government are pushing for close ties between the state and the military. Despite the current power struggle, the generals have the best intentions for the Union, and to snub them in victory would be unwise.\n\nOthers argue that the period of military rule exposes how dangerous the military's leadership is. They claim that the generals have shown themselves for the power-hungry stratocrats they are, and the only way to preserve the stability of a civilian government is by putting the military in its place."
PRC_Talk_To_The_Civilians_desc: "The bureaucrats have been subdued, but one opponent to our rule still remains: the people. As the debate over military rule continues, the bureaucracy has effectively mobilized the people of Central Siberia in favor of civilian governance. Now, even after their leaders have submitted, the people continue to cause trouble, staging strikes and protests across our territory. We must act quickly to put a stop to this and gain their trust.\n\nThough we will not give them everything they want, we can offer a few token reforms to the civilians as proof of our good intentions. If shortening the workday in non-military industries and lessening the presence of army officers in state unions will put an end to the marches and demonstrations, then so be it. We are fighting for the people after all, whether they know it or not."
PRC_Ensure_Our_Rule_desc: "We cannot move forward until our authority is secure, and our authority will not be secure until we are popular among the common people of our realm. So long as the people resent our rule we will never be safe, the simmering threat of rebellion forcing us to look over our own shoulders constantly. If the Union is to be remade, we must have the backing of its people.\n\nA nationwide propaganda campaign will begin, presenting the Red Army as an organization of benevolent protectors, committed to fighting for socialism and the people of Russia, and intent on relinquishing control as soon as it is safe to do so. Along with disappearing a few troublesome agitators and organizers, this should be enough to show the people we are not just another warlord army but a true continuation of the spirit of the Soviet Union."
PRC_A_New_Future_desc: "The long awaited day is finally drawing near. After months of squabbling and paranoia the issue of military rule will be settled once and for all. All eyes are on Krasnoyarsk as the bureaucrats, generals, and the people they both wish to represent all anxiously await the results of the conference. Despite fears of coups and plots, it seems that we have managed to avoid the worst excesses of factionalism, but no one will be certain until a definitive result is announced.\n\nThe future awaits us, and no matter who leads the nation forwards there is still a long road ahead. The motherland lies in ruins after decades of war, and to our east and west lie more potential enemies who would seek to undo everything we have achieved. They shall not succeed. Whether we follow the Revolutionary Government or the Red Army, one thing is certain. Our victory draws near."


PRC_The_New_Territories_desc: "Against all odds, we have won the war against our rivals, and are one step closer to uniting Russia once more. But all future plans for national unification are useless, even dangerous, if we don't create stability in our new territories.\n\nIn order to do that, we will have to deal with the former warlord holdouts in this region, the old bureaucracies that dealt with the day to day activities of governments, and deciding the fates of our old enemies. In addition, we must deal with the Workers' Revolt, its origins, and how to avoid such an outcome in the future.\n\nOnly by dealing with these problems now can we afford to look towards the horizon of a better, more prosperous future for Russia and her people."
PRC_Kostins_Legacy_desc: "Regardless of how you view it, the workers of Central Siberia are in less than ideal circumstances. Despite our best attempts, there are many workers who distrust us and our policies, believing us to be enemies of the people and the workers of the world. This animosity, combined with easy access to firearms, led to the powder-keg that was the Workers Revolt, headed by Vitaly Kostin and other leaders.\n\nAlthough defeated, Kostin and his revolt have made a major impact upon the workers of Siberia, widening their eyes to the possibility of overthrowing our government by force. We must deal with these rabble rousers who would lead the workers of Russia down a dangerous road of defenselessness against fascists in the name of 'freedom' and 'liberty'.\n\nWe all agree there is a problem. But how do we deal with it?"
PRC_Pardon_Them_desc: "We cannot pretend that this revolt was simply an action by rabble rousing anarchists. The fact is, many workers were swayed by the points made by Kostin and his ilk. They are distrustful of us, making them more susceptible to lies and demagoguery.\n\nPardoning the leaders of this revolt is a first step of goodwill, allowing them to go home and back to their families. Acts of retribution against former rebels will be punished. Reforming our treatment of the workers is just as important. The life of the worker must be made healthier, safer and comfortable than before. Unsafe work environments must be dealt with, in addition to incompotent bureaucrats that are more concerned with maintaining production quotas than the well being of workers.\n\nWe will prove our enemies wrong through our deeds."
PRC_Smash_Them_desc: "We must crush them. These demagogues and their pseudo-leftist language must be destroyed before they can even begin to think about poisoning the mind of the proletariat. Kostin and his ilk must be dealt with, swiftly and without mercy, just like any fascist.\n\nAnd Kostin would be the beginning. Any activities that would begin corrupting the mind of the proletariat must be eliminated. Large rewards will be given to anyone who has any information on former members or leaders of the revolt. Entire security teams must be assembled to deal with the threat. Everything must be done to avoid another incident like this from happening ever again."
PRC_Defeat_Warlord_Pockets_desc: "While we have asserted ourselves as the leaders of Central Siberia, we are still dealing with holdouts of warlordism in frontier villages throughout our territory. Some of them are attempting to revive their former fiefdoms, while others are hoping to carve something for themselves. Regardless, they are threats that must be dealt with if we are to even think about expanding outwards. Although it would take many years to deal with all of them, we can at least expand resources of local law enforcement and our security agencies to destroy the most organized and dangerous of them all."
PRC_Make_An_Offer_desc: "We have already spilled enough blood unifying Central Siberia. Too many men, young and old, died to just get us this far. It would be a waste to kill people who could still be of use to us. That is why, instead of using force, we shall use a more peaceful method of creating peace and stability in our new territories: integration.\n\nBy offering these holdouts amnesty in exchange for offering their services as generals and soldiers to the Revolutionary Council, we can both utilize the manpower and intelligence of these generals for our own purposes, without the unnecessary bloodshed involved."
PRC_Integrate_Our_Land_desc: "Up until now, most of our land has been under de facto martial law, operated by military personnel and local sympathizers. This has made administrating the land very difficult for us. This is why we must begin the long, arduous process of officially integrating the land into our bureaucracy. This will require local organs of administration that are loyal to the government, bringing back old civil servants found politically reliable, and increasing services that would improve our ability to maintain control. The military's role will be scaled back, at least in an official capacity."
PRC_Towards_Peace_And_Unity_desc: "Integration is only the beginning. We must unify the people of Central Siberia under one banner, towards a better and brighter future. By doing so, we can begin picking up the broken pieces that were the Soviet Union, and finally, after all these years, to deal with the problems that plagued the Old Union. By doing so, we can not only unify Central Siberia, but all of Russia, under one banner of peace and unity, just as the Bolsheviks of old did."
PRC_Put_Traitors_On_Trial_desc: "Robespierre once said that 'Softness to traitors will destroy us all.' That is a motto that many civilizations have refused to heed. Rome's liberty was destroyed by the treason of Caesar. France's revolution for liberty was betrayed by Napoleon, who replaced loyalty to humanity's freedom with his own desire for imperial glory. Russia, in her attempt to create a glorious path for humanity, was backstabbed by a thousand traitors, some of them robing themselves in flags of glory, philosophy, or freedom.\n\nAnd they will be dealt with. Every last one of them. One way, or another."
PRC_Birth_Of_A_State_desc: "The territories have been integrated. Our people are being unified as we speak. In the air is a new cause, a new feeling among the people that is beginning to unify them under a single banner. It is the development of a newfound national identity, based around the ideological beliefs of Marxist-Leninism and for the creation of a unified state for Russia and her peoples.\n\nBut in order for a state to be created, order must be maintained. Not just of the law, but of the nature of society itself. Everyone knows their place, and they may advance at a pace that will be beneficial to the State of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the State alone. We are entering a new era of order, for now and all time."
PRC_Peace_In_Central_Siberia_desc: "Peace. That is something that Central Siberia hasn't known for a long time. For many years it has been a hell hole, with bandits and petty warlords playing ruler, leaving the average citizen at the mercy of anarchy and chaos.\n\nBut no more. We have created order and stability in a place few expected it. The revolution has been secured for now, but not for long. Only by unifying Russia can it be protected against all potential threats. That is why we must look outward, for the future and safety of our nation and our people!"


PRC_Into_the_Military_Front_desc: "The Red Army now stands victorious, rising high from the frigid plains of Central Siberia to the harsh steppe of Mongolia. While the time is not yet right to unite the rest of Russia under the rightful domain of Premier Vasilevsky and the Red Army, many in the high command are suggesting a major doctrine overhaul and general army reform. Yes, our men may be equipped, our vehicles may be running, and we are ready to fight, but if we are willing to stand up toward the rest of Russia, further professionalization and standardization of our methods will need to happen.\n\nAlready, members of the High Command gather in the capital, discussing the wars we have fought, how they were won or lost, and what we could've done better regardless. In the coming weeks, the Red Army will have a new, glorious direction; one so perfect that no other army in the other regions could stand in our way!"
PRC_Great_Patriotic_War_Legacy_desc: "The Red Army will never forget the blood shed during the Great Patriotic War. Despite it being a time of great strife, sacrifice, and pain for our Motherland, it was also a time of military genius. The best minds in our country came together and innovated, at the time, groundbreaking doctrine to fight the Germans. While many outsiders have dubbed it "Mass Assault", the High Command was particularly fond of the term "Deep Battle". While Deep Battle emphasized many things, a major proponent of Deep Battle was precise, surgical quickly executed plans designed to overwhelm and breakthrough key points of enemy positions.\n\nAlthough we did not have the industrial capacity to execute our old battle plans, many in the high command are excited about the renewal and refreshal of Deep Battle. Premier Vasilevsky has given the plan the green light, this time, with a particular focus on mechanized and tank warfare. May it serve our Army well enough to reunify our lands!"
PRC_Our_Man_Will_March_desc: "An old myth told by the invading Wehrmacht was that only half of our troops were given rifles, due to the massive size and raw manpower of the Red Army. We are now ready to put this disastrous myth to rest. Our men will march into any battle carrying the finest revolutionary equipment we can manufacture. SMGs, assault rifles, protective clothing, proper support equipment, and steady rations will be guaranteed for men in our service.\n\nAnother myth was told by the invading Wehrmacht, one that our troops were untrained barbarians, nothing more than simple peasant conscripts to be slaughtered in a meat grinder! The modern German soldier would cower and flee from our new men, hardened by rigorous training standards, with prowess in both attack and defense, and a full theater of combined arms support equally as experienced behind them.\n\nThe Red Army will no longer be an insufficient force, but rather the standard for infantry-focused armies all across the continent. Wherever our men march, victory marches behind them!"
PRC_Warlord_Era_Legacy_desc: "Our current strategy around military conflict is focused around the recent experiences of our battles during the Warlord Era. Throughout the areas of conflict spanning our region of the Russian Anarchy, our men and officers have adapted a particular set of techniques to be executed in a flexible, combined manner. While this doctrine has no particular set name among the High Command, many consider the prospect of utilizing these recent combined operations to the highest effect, and reforming them to deal with the other states of the Russian Anarchy.\n\nOur Army was born with men, and it will either live or die on the backs of men. As such, it is crucial to apply the lessons we have learned during our regional reunification and battles with other Warlord states to support these men in the best way we can. Premier Vasilevsky has given the plan the green light, this time, with a particular focus on adaptability as well as general infantry interoperability. May it serve our Army well enough to reunify our lands!"
PRC_Right_Hand_of_the_Soldiers_desc: "Men alone cannot win our wars. Backed by powerful guns and the right support, however, they can defeat any foe. One of the most powerful compliments to any infantry fighting force is artillery. While the use and tech has changed dramatically since the First World War, artillery is still crucial for bombing enemy positions, destroying emplacements, and raining hellfire from a position advantageous to our men. Our current artillery technology is dramatically outdated; our shells lack potency, our existing pieces are aging, and artillery crews lack sufficient equipment as well as training. No more!\n\nStarting now, the Red Army will undergo a massive artillery renovation and revitalization. Our freshly manufactured, quality guns will obliterate our enemies with powerful shells, all while our men make precise marks and calls for the artillery itself. When the foes of the Red Army hear the sky roar, they shall run in fear, for death is now imminent!"
PRC_Our_Tanks_Will_Run_desc: "Following the overhaul and reevaluation of our armed forces high command, top generals from across the army have come forward with a request for the government to take a look at the models and mechanics of the tanks themselves. While our existing tank technology is fine, it will soon struggle against the technological advancements of the enemies. As such, Premier Vasilevsky has allocated increased research and military funding to the area of tank development.\n\nExisting designs will be overhauled with new guns, tracks, and parts. Newer models will soon roll off the assembly line, matching the armies in the east and west. Our tanks will be reliable, sturdy, powerful, harder, better, faster, and stronger. We will not rest until the perfect piece of our doctrinal puzzle is perfected! When our men fight, they will only be supported by the finest tanks this side of Russia!"
PRC_Army_of_the_Tundras_desc: "If the Red Army is to stand dominant across Russia, they must master the tundra.\n\nSiberia is a land of many climates and landscapes, but is most notably dominated by specific climates and terrain. Our men are accustomed to this, but further training and hardening will do wonders for their performance in the field. The climate of Central Siberia is our friend; it will make us prepared for any conditions we may face across Russia, and it will punish any unprepared invaders trying to seize our lands. As such, it is paramount that our men become known as the Army of the Tundra. Winter training exercises will become the norm, followed by special equipment to help our men with cold acclimatization. Furthermore, a general water and snow-proofing of our important equipment will go a long way in any war we shall fight across Siberia and beyond. The other contenders for Mother Russia may doubt such measures, but we will be ready regardless of their perceptions."
PRC_Expand_Helicopter_Divisions_desc: "Few can deny the utility of our "Air Cavalry" formations. The mobility conferred by their steel mounts allowed our commanders to make use of once-unthinkable tactics, and time after time again granted our men the ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Yet, their numbers are few, and their equipment old and worn out.\n\nAs such, a program to modernize and expand our Air Cavalry formations shall be initiated. New pilots and new soldiers shall bolster the ranks of our elite Airborne troops, while expanded training facilities and modern production lines will ensure that our forces will go into battle properly trained and fully equipped.\n\nWhile the mount and saber may be consigned to history, the legacy of the red horseman shall live on in the skies."
PRC_Red_Air_Force_desc: "Our Air Force is nothing to write home about. Its planes are old and out of date, flying from airbases that consist of little more than a grassy field with some supporting infrastructure, and routinely found themselves outmatched by our adversaries in the skies over Central Siberia.\n\nIf we are to unite Russia under our banner, this situation needs to change and, with the industry and resources of Central Siberia under our control, we now have means to do so.\n\nA program of investment into the Red Air Force will help bring them into the modern age. New airfields, new aircraft, and the facilities to train a new generation of pilots in the art of aerial warfare. "
PRC_Bomber-Focused_Doctrine_desc: "The Great Patriotic War and our recent campaigns against Pokryshkin's secessionists in Novosibirsk have taught us the value of bombers. Versatile and well rounded, they are capable of both heavily damaging enemy industry and infrastructure as well as supporting our troops on the ground with tactical air strikes.\n\nAs such, a plan to develop and produce new bomber designs shall be initiated, while a parallel program will aim to familiarize our pilots and commanders in their use and operation. Re-orienting our air force around these versatile aircraft.\n\nThe enemy will learn to fear these terrors of the sky."
PRC_Fighter-Focused_Doctrine_desc: "The failure to wrestle control of the skies helped lead to our defeat in the Great Patriotic War and were the origin of many of the struggles we faced in our campaign to reclaim Central Siberia. While we lacked the resources to rectify such issues, the reclamation of Central Siberia has finally granted us the opportunity to fix the mistakes of the past.\n\nA plan to develop and produce new fighter designs shall be initiated, and further emphasis placed on the necessity of securing air superiority. Our airforce will first and foremost be aimed at controlling the skies, even at a cost to its other capabilities.\n\nThe enemy will learn to respect our knights of the sky."
PRC_Foreign_Weapons_desc: "Many of the weapons currently in our storage are either relics of the Patriotic War or barely working at all. We should work to make diplomatic contacts with the international community to get access to new, modern weapons that will give us the necessary edge over our enemies.\n\nThe Americans, Japanese, and other European powers will likely be willing to assist us in sending these modern weapons. However, we can't always expect to receive weapons for free, so we may have to make a few agreements that will be necessary to receive the guns, support equipment, and anti-tank equipment we need. It will all pay off once we reunite Russia."
PRC_The_Soviet_War_Machine_desc: "With our army reforms complete and our military modernized, we are ever more prepared to retake the motherland. The Red Army is now one of the strongest and most powerful in Russia, ready to take on any reactionary threat. Our new capabilities far surpass what we once were, and our enemies should fear our might!"

PRC_Restoring_our_Riches_desc: "We have finally, at long last, achieved control over a large portion of Siberia. This is a great victory, but now the real work begins. Our economy, such as it was, was structured wholly around the needs of a military fighting for survival, and yet now it must be retooled to underpin the state as a whole.\n\nThis will not be simple or fast, but it is absolutely necessary, and we will approach it the same way we did our armed campaigns of years recent and otherwise - with determination! We achieved victory then, and we will do so again."
PRC_Establish_a_Budget_desc: "As one of the first steps of administering a proper state economy, we must take action to establish a clear budget, with all the priorities, competing sectors, and needs that such implies.\n\nThough some have questioned the need, and though it will surely involve many tradeoffs and sacrifices, in the end establishing this practice will not only increase economic efficiency, but will also allow us to track where the money is going. A military might not need that knowledge, but a state very much does."
PRC_The_Siberian_Wealth_desc: "We have many, many challenges in trying to establish a functioning economy, but we do have one enormous asset to leverage in response: the lands that we have conquered and secured.\n\nSiberia possesses resource wealth almost beyond measure, and we must take advantage of this in every way possible. We will therefore survey every deposit we can find, and begin extractive operations as quickly as possible."
PRC_Novosibirsk_Civilian_Industry_desc: "Novosibirsk, as the largest city in Siberia, possessed considerable concentrations of civilian industry. Now that both the city and those industries belong to us, we must act to expand them and compound the local advantages of concentration.\n\nWe will promote the operation - and further expansion - of these industries, and so increase the state's industrial output by a significant amount"
PRC_Oil_Exploration_desc: ""We need oil".\nThis demand echo both from our civilian industry as well as from our military commanders. To try to answer both sides requests, we have to exploit the Siberian oilfield, even if our lack of modern machineries will make it an expensive endeavour."
PRC_tuning_our_economy_desc: "As we leave behind our warlord past and turn into a fully fledged state, our brightest minds turn toward the most vital domain one's state needs to dabble in if it wants to survive and thrive: economics.\n\nThough we are not petty warlords anymore, Russia remains a land full of strife and misery, something which should be taken into account in our decision making. Furthermore, it is undeniable that the Red Army has a significant influence in the PRC, to the point that we might as well be an army with a state rather than the reverse! Perhaps this is proof enough that our economy should be fully geared towards war to accommodate our comrades in red. Or should be we pushing instead for a civilian economy, one able to accommodate our citizens who have suffered greatly over the last two decades and always came second to our military forces?"
PRC_Connect_the_Cities_desc: "Within the Siberian territories that we control, there are major urban centres and concentrations of industry. The problem, however, is that they are separated by vast distances, and the infrastructure connecting them is often old, poorly maintained, or simply non-existent.\n\nWe will correct this by commencing a program of infrastructure construction. Connecting these cities cannot but provide enormous economic benefit, and potentially more besides."
PRC_Expand_Industrial_Centers_desc: "Our efforts to expand the state's industrial base have been very successful - but there is still more that can be, and therefore will be, done. We now possess the means to begin another program of construction within our industrial centers.\n\nThis time, however, our focus will be on efficiency - both of the construction itself and of the factories and plants resulting. Hopefully, in time, this focus will help our economy as a whole improve."
PRC_Biysk_Military_Industry_desc: "Biysk is a reasonably sized city and, consequently, it has a reasonably sized population. What it does not have, the product of long years under the previous regime, is any appreciable amount of military industry. We must correct this.\n\nWe will target our next program of expansion on Biysk and the lands around it, and put the people there to work for the good of the armed forces, and thus the good of the state."
PRC_Norilsk_Legacy_desc: "The enormous resource deposits at Norilsk, a crucial supportive part of Bukharin's Siberian Plan, are under our control. Though they have been subjected to many years of neglect and decay, they are still there, and they are valuable.\n\nWe will explore what remains of them, hopefully return them to operation, and direct the important resources they produce and process into our other industries."
PRC_Prepared_for_War_desc: "While our unification of Central Siberia is certainly commendable, further wars are very likely to await us on our path to the reunification of Russia, possibly against other states controlling large amounts of territory and industry. As such, our current economic system will no longer be sufficient for our purposes. We must adopt a War Economy, devoting the national efforts of the workers to the purpose of defeating any remaining enemies of communist ideals and liberating those Russians still living under their governments."
PRC_Into_the_Modern_Age_desc: "Due to the events of the past two decades, Russia as a whole has quite severely fallen behind the rest of the civilized world when it comes to technology. Our guns, our radios, even our factories- all of them are out of date and flawed when compared to newer types, and this shows in the poor quality of our forces relative to those outside the former Union. To correct this, we will invest a large amount of money in building research facilities and training new scientists, to improve the rate of technological development and allow us to catch up."
PRC_The_Soviet_Worker_desc: "With all the suffering Russia has endured, workers no longer have many real heroes to idolize and try to emulate, causing morale to suffer. Therefore, it would be an immense boon to the cause of the workers to invent such a figure. A common laborer, standing tall over Siberia, who places the revolution before himself and works long hours for no other reason to see it succeed in freeing his fellow workers from their chains. This will be the feature of every propaganda poster from Novosibirsk to Kansk, inspiring the people to serve communism so that it may in turn serve them."
PRC_Farms_of_the_Future_desc: "In order to ensure that none go hungry, reforms are badly needed in the agricultural sector, which has grown inefficient and outdated since the collapse of the Union. Mechanization of the farms and fields is an important part of this, as it is much more labor-intensive for farmers to grow their crops through entirely or near-entirely physical work. Another important part is the improvement of conditions for farm workers, which have deteriorated greatly since the Siberian War. Finally, implementing modern farming techniques should allow farmers to produce more crops with less land. Together, these will make our agriculture more productive than it has ever been."
PRC_New_Industrial_Methods_desc: "While our industrial capacity has improved greatly from what it once was, much work remains to be done. The expertise of our workers remains imperfect, especially when compared with those living in those states outside Russia. There are also many inefficiencies in production, especially when it comes to the organization within factories. These problems can be solved by improving the training of industrial experts so that they can compete with the finest, and reorganizing industry to streamline production and eliminate any inefficiency. Once that is accomplished, we will reach new heights of productivity."
PRC_Import_Electronic_Designs_desc: "One of the areas in which we currently find ourselves lacking is the design and production of electronics. Disappointingly, this is not a problem we can resolve on our own, and we must rely on imports from the outside for our electronics. Currently, these imports occur at a low, informal level, if at all, and as such the electronics in many parts of our territory are severely outdated. However, if we were to begin increasing such imports and looking into the workings of foreign electronics, we may soon be able to produce our own, allowing us to further close the gap with the outside world in both military and civilian sectors."
PRC_Education_for_All_desc: "The current education system within the territory we control is reprehensible and must be corrected immediately. Outside the largest cities, formal education is often either severely lacking in supplies and current information, if it is available at all. Even in the cities of the region, schools are often understaffed and the morale of those teachers they do have is low. In order to improve this situation, we have decided upon several reforms worth implementing. These include higher pay, recruitment campaigns, and sending school supplies and up-to-date books to rural areas. This will make education more available to the entire population, and bring us closer to equality."
PRC_Restore_the_Universities_desc: "In large cities within our territory such as Novosibirsk and Tomsk, there have long been impressive universities, and although their standing had been greatly damaged by the collapse of the Union and then of the Central Siberian Republic, they continued to operate. However, the unification of the region under our control has proven to be the final straw, and they were finally forced to close. Of course, we will reopen them, but to avoid the reactionary lies of the past, we will apply our own education methods, and thereby bring them to new heights of prestige."


PRC_The_International_Field_desc: "Despite being essentially an Army with a State, Premier Vasilevsky understands the importance of good relations with foreign powers. The shared opinion of many in the government and the populace is that our revolution will not last long without our involvement in the world. To successfully reunify Russia, we require trade, diplomatic prestige and military and material support. Bukharin's relative isolation was one of the many nails in the coffin for Mother Russia during the Great Patriotic War, and we will not make the same mistake twice. In our new Russia, we shall sit among the greatest powers in the world, working together in the fields of economics, science, and military prowess. We will no longer be the black sheep of the global community, but a proud member of it.\n\nWhile this is all good to dream about, it will never become a reality if we do not act on it. The government is currently getting to work forming these various connections, and they will hopefully be ones which ensure the survival of our nation."
PRC_Over_the_Asian_Continent_desc: "Suffering under the Japanese boot, the peoples of Asia have much in common with us and our goals. On the other side of the coin, Japan is one of the world's major powers, and securing recognition by them would go a long way towards improving our legitimacy as a state, even if we don't particularly get along. As such, it would be wisest to open up diplomatic relations across Asia, to simultaneously undermine the Japanese and strengthen ourselves through their power. To accomplish this, emissaries will be dispatched across Asia to establish contacts and seek to open embassies."
PRC_Search_for_Recognition_desc: "Now that we have established a foothold in Central Siberia, the next most important step for our revolution besides internal stabilization is to appeal for recognition among the various nations of the world. While we would certainly benefit from friends in the United States and perhaps even Japan, smaller nations around the world recognizing our regime would give us amazing rewards. A Soviet diplomatic corps will be established, and they will soon be sent across the globe to gain favor and support for our nation. Our corps will consist of some of our finest and most charismatic men, men who will win over the hearts and minds of influential allies from the streets of Washington to the venues of Rome. While this is in motion, a large part of our government will get ready to ensure safe travel out of the country for our diplomats and get ready for the influx of foreign interests in our government. Although the investment and risk is massive, the payoff will very well see us as the preeminent power in Russia"
PRC_The_Central_Asia_Countries_desc: "Central Asia has a certain closeness to Russia and its rulers, going back hundreds of years. While the region formally separated and became multiple independent states with the collapse of the Union, many informal ties remain, especially when it comes to trade. Siberia and Central Asia are still heavily linked economically but suffer from a lack of formal governmental support for these links. As such it would be both to our benefit and theirs to establish formal trade agreements between our states, to ease access and reduce the cost of trading."
PRC_Solidarity_to_the_Socialist_Cause_desc: "We are, as we have always been, champions of the socialist cause, and the ultimate global victory of communism remains our eventual goal. With the world the way it is, however, there's no room for delay in supporting communism in other countries, or else the fire of revolution might be stamped out by the fascist dogs. The first step we can take towards preventing this is to establish relations with other existing communist states, supporting them both directly and indirectly to ensure their continued existence. Only when the survival of communism is assured can the flames spread."
PRC_Friends_in_the_Western_Hemisphere_desc: "The Americas will provide our greatest chance for global recognition. Home to the OFN, the last bastion of the free world, enough resources to fuel any nation, as well as being relatively closer to our nation than Europe, our diplomatic corps have placed great importance on the region. Canada, Mexico, and the United States each offer avenues for negotiation and diplomatic association. While one of our diplomatic envoys is touring Parliament Hill in Ottawa, the other two are going for dinners in San Francisco and meeting with government ministers in Mexico City. Regardless of their initial success, our efforts will certainly pave the way for stronger and more formal relations with each of these powers."
PRC_Deal_with_the_OFN_desc: "While the OFN is a quagmire of down-on-their-luck bourgeois democracies, they offer our best chance for military and economic aid. We both share many goals: The destruction of the fascist menace in Europe, the reunification of a free-world aligned Russia, stable as well as prosperous economic growth, and the strengthening of our militaries against any threat which may face us.\n\nSince the Fall of Europe, OFN policy has dramatically softened toward communist and communist-aligned nations. This is great news for us, as despite the strong differences in our government type, it pales in comparison toward the desire of crushing fascism as well as eliminating the scourge of nazism in Germany. Every Red Army soldier who fought and died on the Eastern Front will be vindicated with an alliance with the West, much how every American soldier who died on the hills of Scotland will be vindicated once Russia proves a useful ally in crushing the German eagle once and for all!"
PRC_Foreign_Advisors_desc: "While our military has learnt many lessons during the West Russian War and subsequent Warlord period, our army will never reach its full potential without the help of foreign nations. Our officers could learn a lot from American ones, our doctrines may have flaws that only the Italians could catch, and our training methods would grow stronger with a Japanese presence. Given the successes of our recent diplomatic efforts, it would only make sense to try and attract foreign attachés for our nation.\n\nWhile our military would receive the most prominent benefits from this initiative, economic advisors would also go a very long way to ensure the efficiency of our production lines and allocation of resources for our people. While we cannot offer much at the moment, hopefully the lip service done and favors promised by our diplomatic corps is enough to at least bring some sort of foreign aid to our nation's army and wallet..."
PRC_Taking_Back_our_Place_desc: "With our diplomatic situation secured, it is nigh time to set our eyes on the rest of Russia. Regardless if they are misguided, fragile democracies, imposter Soviet states, or traitorous fascist-aligned dogs, they all must fall for the good of the nation. We have seen them prepare much like we have; whispers of foreign delegations, movements of men along our borders, and cries for reunification.\n\nThey will not be ready.\n\nSeveral years ago, when Premier Vasilevsky united the Red Army to secure Central Siberia, he dreamed of righting the wrongs of Bukharin's failed Union. That dream is marching closer to reality currently. Final plans are being drafted up for our armies, our people are being coerced by speeches and rallies, and the factories of our country hum ready for war. When the fate of the Union is decided, it will ultimately sway in our favor. The Red Army will be known from the West to the East as the great unifier of Mother Russia, the slayer of the Nazi menace, the liberator of the people, and the rebirth of the strongest nation to exist on this Earth! The bear is back, and he is ready for war!"


### Events ###

PRC.0.t: "War Comes to the Council"
PRC.0.desc: "When the Union collapsed we fled here - this wretched corner of Mongolia, devoid of anything worth having, became our home. We reorganized our shattered divisions, made repairs as best we could to the infrastructure that had not fallen prey to banditry or bullet or bombs, built homes and lives of our own in the shadow of turmoil to the North and East. It was not much, but what else could we do?\n\nIn the same vein, it was also inevitable that the Mengjiang Republic - and their Japanese backers - would turn their envious eyes towards the last corner of old Mongolia not yet under the yoke of the Japanese lapdogs. The entirety of our defensive planning has centred on this central belief: that one day, Kalgaan would come for our piece of the steppes. And yet it might prove insufficient.\n\nAnd as the bullets fly anew across the border with Mengjiang, so painstakingly secured, Mongolian divisions have already begun advancing across it in what appears to be an attempt to remove us altogether. The Red Army awaits them, and the sum total of our military industry behind it. If we must find our end here -"
PRC.0.a: "We shall live, and die, free."

PRC.1.t: "Aid to Mongolia?"
PRC.1.desc: "The Presidium has received an urgent request for aid on the behalf of the nascent Mongolian People's Republic (self-declared) as Mengjiangese troops move into their borderlands. The Republic, at this stage more of a guerilla movement, is almost certainly doomed to defeat if other socialist powers do not intervene - and few and far between are those still friendly to the Red Banner in this portion of Russia.\n\nDebate over the precise form of aid to be sent to the Mongolian PR remains unclear, however. Our already stretched military resources cannot long afford to sponsor a foreign conflict, even if it will prove a distraction to our strategic rival in the region. In addition, Army generals are deadlocked as to the precise form of aid we should send to them.\n\nThe Mongolians favour a direct movement of troops, armed with as light an armament load we can provide, to the Mongolians to harden their battle readiness. The catch, of course, is that these men will consist entirely of Mongolian battalions operating independently of the Red Army. Vasilevsky's Red Army generals propose a shipment of weapons instead. They argue that the weapons will do little good in the hands of poorly trained Mongolians - a direct transfusion would be more helpful to the war effort in the long run. Of course, a sizable detachment of the Presidium supports total inaction, which as debate continues is looking like an increasingly attractive option."
PRC.1.a: "Send arms."
PRC.1.b: "Send men."
PRC.1.c: "Send our regards."

PRC.2.t: "A Bridge too Far"
PRC.2.desc: "Night covers the steppes, from burning Kalgaan to the hustle of Kyzyl. The bickering Party Presidium is still in session, trying despite themselves to work out the logistics of a "defensive" war that has outgrown its lines of supply and strategic scope. The squabble over what to do with the swathes of territory the Red Army has been foisted upon, without any form of administrative structure to control it, is endless and exhausting in its intensity.\n\nOutside it is a quiet night, as the military transports to the front have halted under the threat of approaching sandstorms. Kyzyl itself churns on in a buzz of nascent industry and commerce-work, and the Tuvan people, under snow-capped mountains and between their silver rivers, slumber and work through the night as they have done for centuries. It is beautiful, moon-lit, clear as an untouched pool in a mountain cave.\n\nThere is nothing obstructing the bomb-sights far overhead.\n\nThe flight of Mitsubishi-manufactured heavy bombers makes it as far as the city centre before they are ripped apart by anti-aircraft defenses, but it is far, far too late for hundreds of workers and households, and the Party Presidium itself is nearly destroyed by shrapnel. What is more distressing still is the wreckage of the bomber squad - the insignia of the Rising Sun is bold and visible to all sifting through the ruins. The pretence of non-interference has been dropped."
PRC.2.a: "Prepare the ceasefire terms."
PRC_JAP_ceasefire: "A §YCeasefire offer§! can be sent to the Japanese side after §Y14 Days§!.\n"

PRC.3.t: "A Future in Central Siberia"
PRC.3.desc: "With our immediate issues solved, it's time we begin our crusade for the reunification of Russia. While the native Mongolian population may not be happy, the spreading of socialism and rebirth of the motherland is much more important. The native Mongolians will have to wait for more development, but now, we go to war, in Russia. Starting with Central Siberia, it will provide an ample base of operations with its large amount of manpower and industrial base. We will have many strong foes to face, but this time, the Red Army will triumph.\n\nThe Mongolian threat has ended, and it's time to bring the Red Army home."
PRC.3.a: "The Red Army marches forward!"

PRC.4.t: "Far from Home"
PRC.4.desc: ""Do you want a cigarette?" The soldier asked his new friends in the platoon. "My name is Vasily. These are quite rare, we smuggled them in from Mongolia. You would be surprised at the comforts the Japanese enjoyed in Ulaanbaatar!" The youngest man, barely over twenty years old, quickly took one, followed by another soldier. All three eagerly sat down in the tent, and as Vasily carefully lighted the cigarettes with an improvised lighter seemingly from the Soviet era, he tried to start a discussion. In the Council's army, there was one question that guaranteed interesting and diverse answers. "Where do you come from?"\n\nAfter exhaling a large cloud of smoke, the youngest man began speaking in broken Russian. "My name is Nergui, and I am actually from here, Mongolia." Someone's voice was heard from the back: "Now that's rare!" Nergui continued anyway. "Joining the army was the first time I went anywhere outside my village. My parents both died fighting the Japanese when I was quite young, but a woman brought me to the safety of the Red Army, which I felt obligated to join years later."\n\nIt was the turn of the oldest officer to speak. "Have you heard the tale of the 226th Battalion? As the Nazi armies swept through Eastern Europe, encircling and crushing entire divisions, the 226th was caught unprepared somewhere in the plains of Belarus. We were encircled, yet hundreds escaped across the German lines, retreating eastwards and pledging to never look back. That is exactly what we did, much like in the Great War. I was the commander of that battalion, and here I am."\n\nVasily, open and social as always, took the freedom to speak for himself. "I am from the city of Omsk. As you can imagine, the unit I was in got called in to defend Mongolia and ... you know the rest. I am just as eager to return to my home, but there's little we can do other than fight our way there.""
PRC.4.a: "They find unity in their differences."

PRC.5.t: "An Army on Credit"
PRC.5.desc: "The war against the Japanese lapdogs in Mengjiang had ended, but not without cost. Severe cost.\n\nExpenditures incurred, though of course necessary and unavoidable, were so ruinous that, in effect, the state no longer has any worthwhile economy of note. With its nascent industrial base, often hostile population, and negligible exports, there is little promise of correcting this problem anytime soon.\n\nIn order to have any hope of doing so in the future, however, the state must expand. Must acquire new territory, new resources, and new populations for taxation. And to do that, it must have an effective standing army. An army that demands to be paid. Such a situation requires a creative solution, and exactly that has been developed.\n\nIt has been proposed that part of future payments to the soldiery be made in promissory notes, deferring the need to compensate them with hard currency and allowing it to be redirected into the purchase of badly needed equipment. The notes themselves would be of greater value than ordinary pay rates, but critically would only be redeemable when the state is in a better economic situation.\n\nIt has been estimated that such a scheme could last for two years at most before collapsing entirely, but if sufficient gains can be made within that window, a crisis could be averted. It only remains to be seen if the state's leadership agrees."
PRC.5.a: "A risk, but a necessary one. Give the order."
PRC.5.b: "No, we will endure without this foolhardy gambit."

PRC.6.t: "Credit Lines Failing"
PRC.6.desc: "When it was first introduced, the architects of the state's promissory note system for military maintenance warned that it could only last so long, and would inevitably fail in time.\n\nThat time is fast approaching.\n\nThe gains of territory, resources, and influence in the period since its commencement have been insufficient to either cover its costs or begin any semblance of payback to the general soldiery. The covenant made is being broken and, what's worse, they know it.\n\nDiscontent is rapidly spreading, discipline is growing weaker - despite harsh measures - and desertions have sharply increased. We must move quickly to secure additional wealth and resources with which to pay our military. We must make good on the pledges made to them before the point of no return is reached, and we lose what confidence they still have in us for good.\n\nFor if we do not, we risk far worse than mere discontent. We risk open and violent insurrection."
PRC.6.a: "We must secure wealth, land, and resources. We must secure payment."

PRC.7.t: "Payday"
PRC.7.desc: "Although the developed system of promissory payment for the state's military was a necessity at the time, in order to maintain any form of cohesion, it was always a risk. Always a gamble.\n\nBut it is a gamble that has paid off.\n\nWith the acquisition of additional territory, resources, and other means, the state now has the capability not only to convert the promissory notes currently outstanding into hard currency, but also to abolish the system in its entirety moving forward.\n\nThus, from now on our soldiers will be paid like those in any other true army. No longer will they grumble about being paid in 'false money,' and no longer will the state suffer from the ill-discipline, discontent, and myriad other negative effects of such a fundamentally-limited emergency policy.\n\nHad this day not been reached, there could have been serious problems indeed, but happily it has been and, in the future, let us hope that such a drastic and risky policy will never be needed again."
PRC.7.a: "A return to normalcy in the military compensation structure."


PRC.8.t: "A Peace With Honors"
PRC.8.desc: "Mengjiang burns. From the foothills of the Altai to the sands of the Gobi, the country is wracked with the ravages of war. Here a mother mourns her entire household, lost to artillery fire; there a factory crumbles for lack of maintenance and resources, as the workers who once manned it rot in unnamed graves, the winds digging patient graves for them with every passing day. Mengjiang burns - rather, it is burning and will burn, and there is no end in sight.\n\nAuthorities in Kalgaan continue to debate the precise ramifications of annexing the territory of the so-called People's Revolutionary Council, and have drawn up plans for a national reunification - yet it is increasingly clear that these plans are unlikely to come to pass in the current strategic environment. Instead the intractable war has siphoned off valuable steel, tungsten and lead that could have buffeted our own domestic industry plans. Our manpower has dispersed from the cities; homes sit empty, markets are closing down plot by plot, and roads gather dust for lack of use.\n\nNow the People's Revolutionary Council's Foreign Affairs Directorate has approached our senior leadership with an offer: an armistice and a return to negotiated boundaries, in exchange for the cessation of hostilities and an expatriation of wounded and imprisoned on both sides. As the casualties mount up and the campaign stretches on, it is becoming clear that this might be our last chance to stabilise affairs and save Mengjiang. And the window is closing fast."
PRC.8.a: "We don't have a choice."

PRC.9.t: "The Steppes Conquered"
PRC.9.desc: "The last to defend the Mengjiang Autonomous Government are the young and the very, very old. Armed with Arisaka variants as old as the Government itself, these "Brigades" have managed almost heroic resistance to the overwhelming intensity of the Red Army's advance, managing orderly retreat even as their trained counterparts dissolved around them. Children struggle with guns almost as large as they are, aged shepherds complain of neck-aches as their packs chafe at their shoulders - and yet, somehow, they have managed to stay organized.\n\nBut as the supply lines from Manchuria and the Central Plain break down under stress and refugees overwhelm the roads, the Brigades, too, falter and stumble. The final concentrated battle of the Mongolian War is less of a battle and more of an encirclement and quick-march - 3,000 Brigadiers are captured in a single night as a swathe of frontline is destroyed by Red Guard tactical maneuvers. Most are captured without a fight, and it becomes apparent that even the last vanguard of Mengjiang have barely enough ammunition between them to destroy a force a tenth their size.\n\nThe Central Government sends vain and desperate messages to Tokyo and to Nanjing, to Hsinking, Amur and Magadan, in its final hours. But a bleeding heart can only muster the strength to beat on for so long. As the remaining Brigades fall apart and back, Mengjiang accepts the inevitable. Its final organized act sends its head leadership to refuge in Beijing just before the final surrender is signed."
PRC.9.a: "So, then, a triumph."

PRC.10.t: "A Single Sun Under The Steppes"
PRC.10.desc: "History, as the Chinese say, goes in cycles. Again and again the Steppes have been ripped apart by foreign intervention and domestic strife, and every time their people have suffered for it. The Revolutionary Council held its people under the yoke of the rifle for decades after the Red Banner that it answered to had collapsed, lurching under the weight of its own bloated military - and yet, unbelievably, it held on.\n\nA nation, once united, must divide - once divided, must unite. For every time the Steppes have fallen into disunity, a conqueror has risen to wield its fragments into a mighty whole. And as the People's Revolutionary Council's last troops fall back to mountain redoubts and Kyzyl itself falls to enemy hands, it is becoming clear that Mengjiang is that conqueror. Japanese armaments, Chinese logistical support and Mongolian force of arms have overwhelmed all opposition in their path - a clear proof of the superiority of Pan Asian ideology. Mongolia's people will welcome reunion with open arms, the nation has already begun to rebuild, and the signs to a better world are emerging from the mist.\n\nThat is what the propaganda texts say, anyway. The reality belies this: Kyzyl's former territories seethe with revolt, guerilla activity in the lands of the former Mongolian PR has reached unmanageable levels, and negotiations with the Japanese over economic autonomy are approaching breakdown. As the Sun dawns uncontested over the Steppes, it is unclear if the morning will be one of peace or bloodshed - only that dawn is approaching, and that none can stand against it."
PRC.10.a: "Peace at last."

PRC.11.t: "One Last Dance"
PRC.11.desc: "From Kyzyl to the Tannu-Olan Mountains, Tuva and West Mongolia burn. The Far Eastern Red Army had trained for this scenario for close to a decade and a half, in the full knowledge that all its men and military might would barely stand an even chance against the might of the Mengjiangese. It had always been a gamble, and the gamble, as is becoming apparent, has failed.\n\nChoibalsan, Koshkin, Getman - the three huddle in their improvised bunker, the sounds of Mongolian artillery growing ever sharper and shriller around them. The stench of cordite, blood and smoke is thick in the air. No one knows if there is a Central Presidium left to report to, or if there is anything worth reporting outside the casualty counts. There are barely any supplies left to distribute to the troops, the food has run dry, the water supply is on its last legs and refugees choke the old roads back to Central Russia for miles behind the Army's scattered footholds.\n\nThere is, in the end, one last choice, one last privilege to claim for the three generals. One last march into history.\n\nThe attack is ordered at dawn, and Choibalsan's troops march straight towards concentrated artillery fire - with Koshkin and Getman attempting a spearhead to break through enemy lines. The three wave swords all the way into enemy lines, yelling in their tongues to muster their armies in one last, desperate tango."

PRC.15.t: "The Extraordinary Bill Of Rights"
PRC.15.desc: "This much is true: no matter how much the Free People's Revolutionary Council's military hierarchy would like to deny it, the Mongolians are the backbone of the Red Army's domestic military production chains, or as other nations would call it, the economy. Despite the best attempts of Vasilevsky and his men to alleviate pressure on the Presidium, there is no denying that local presence is minimal in governmental institutions and generally insignificant where it is present. This might go some way towards explaining why the People's Revolutionary Council has looked for two decades to Russia for salvation despite the best wishes of its residents.\n\nUnder trying domestic circumstances (and the threat of a general strike by Mongolian transport agencies) the Presidium folds. The Mongolians are promised a quota, as in the old days of the Soviets, of ethnic and geographic representation in their local elections, although the one-candidate-per-election policy is to remain untouched. Mongolians are also to receive massive boosts in education, social welfare and economic status, while the deteriorating housing tenements of Kyzyl are to receive especial attention and eventual reform.\n\nThe general reaction, outside a select few military complexes, is one of jubilation. Fireworks explode on the streets of Kyzyl as the citizens celebrate an early Jubilee, until they are shooed away by profoundly irritated security troopers. It is a tentative step forward, but a step into the future nonetheless."

PRC.17.t: "In The Silence, A Still Small Voice"
PRC.17.desc: "That morning Dorgene rose earlier than usual - the cries of the pasture had been particularly strident the previous night, and the sheep roamed restlessly around poor Borgin as he yapped. Perhaps they startled too easily, or perhaps the movements of the previous months had kept them on perpetual edge. Whole convoys of trucks sweeping the plains here and there, their growls filling the endless silence. One or two of the flock had broken pasture altogether, fleeing for parts unknown - perhaps the lights at night had simply driven them mad. Dorgene had never quite seen anything like it.\n\nThe chill airs of the dawn made for good tea, and the little slice of compressed leaves she had hacked off a tea-block in a bazaar in the southeast were, after a few minutes, fragrant. Their essence swirled in the air as Dorgene waited for the cup to cool. In that endless slowness, where life itself seemed to curl thick and rich around the warm places, it was easy to lose oneself; to feel one's essence fusing with an ancient rhythm that would outlast the moment.\n\nThe eternal was interrupted by a series of horns, and then a slow thundering - as dots swarmed on the horizon, Dorgene watched masses of men, thick like forest trunks, march into view. All wore the garments and arms of soldiers - all wore the insignia of sickle and hammer - and their faces shone with exultance. Behind them trucks and bulky treaded wagons rolled into view, bearing only one word in Mongolian and Russian:"

"Comrades - friends - some months ago you entrusted me with piloting our, ah, technological innovations and bringing our military units up to speed with their use. Preliminary trials with combined-arms units and further research on unit speed, maneuverability and effectiveness have concluded, and I am here to bring you the results."\n\nHe swallows, the action visibly costing him. Is that sweat forming on his collar?\n\n"It's. Ah. It's not good. We're looking at drastically decreased combat effectiveness - in exercise conditions, mind you - against even inferior forces, and for some reason our military units are failing to respond to the new technology. We have reports of widespread maintenance breakdowns in some departments - some artillery cannons got mixed up with honest-to-god anti-aircraft flak guns - and all of this, gentlemen, was held in exercise conditions. Combat conditions will prove far, far worse."\n\nNow he summons the courage for a piercing gaze, one that lingers long after it has left. "What we are doing, comrades - it isn't working. If we don't move fast - and decisively - I will not have the luxury of being scolded by you after my defeat. For as it stands, one or two defeats will mean I no longer have an Army to answer to you for.""

PRC.19.desc: "Oyrotia is a small land of many oddities. Zakolovo is standing in the midst of such an oddity when the message from Kyzyl arrives - Bolsheviks on his left and right, both embittered atheists watching a relatively young priest perform a ritual in a provincial church.\n\nThey are, commendably enough, trying not to yawn. It was an especial demand on the part of the Ecclesiastical Council that the representatives sent to Oryotia's central church be "wakeful", or at least dignified in their semi-consciousness: Old Believers in the small country have always taken their demands with the utmost seriousness, even if the rest of Russia never did.\n\nA few words from his clustered aides are enough to melt his genial looks and recast them into foreboding creases. He barks at the procession, and half the parish seats are vacated in a frenzy. There is to be a meeting - and Zakolovo has never tolerated those who fail to show themselves at meetings, excusable or not.\n\nAs the representatives of the brittle little nation file in one by one into the meeting-hall that passes for a conference room, the incipient President wastes little time. Svobodny's Red Guards have waited long decades to march into the territory. Their patience, it appears, is now at an end.\n\nResistance is, quite frankly, futile. Oyrotia is outnumbered, outgunned, friendless - it would make more sense to conquer the ocean than to push back the People's Revolutionary Council, for at least the sea retreats twice a day. But the fate of dissidents in the hands of the Red Army is unpromising, to say the least. Surely it would be better to die on one's feet than to kneel to bondage?"

They are, Zakolovo thinks to himself, his greatest legacy. Had he had more time, perhaps this place could have become far more: an oasis of peace spreading tendrils through Central Russia, a new gospel of reconciliation for a world thirsty for hope.\n\nAs he looks before the annexation accords, he brushes such hopes out of his mind's eye. His only hope now is that something of what he has done will survive the Red Army, and that the people he once ruled will find peace. Nothing will be gained from remembering lost dreams - only heartbreak.\n\nThe General's voice is gentle next to his Guards' harsh silence and stony faces, as Zakolovo asks about the fate of the people, the fate of the Churches, the fate of those Bukharinists who are to move into exodus for the second time in 30 years - he promises nothing even as he assures the President of best wishes and hope for the future. Only the gentle, it seems, could be so brutal in their honesty.\n\nThere is little to stop the march of history now, and no point delaying its advance. Zakolovo signs, and prays for forgiveness from the judgement of posterity, in that tiny little church far from windswept Kyzyl. Perhaps God hears, or perhaps He does not; either way, Oyrotia is too far gone to notice if he does."

PRC.21.t: "Rage Against the Dying"
PRC.21.desc: "The Red Guard unit sent to receive the formal transfer of jurisdiction was growing restive as the morning came. The briefing was clear: Oyrotia stood little chance against the might of the Revolutionary Council, and there was nowhere to hide for its few residents amidst the crowded recesses of Siberia. Refugee life would decimate the little communities here, or consign them to a terrible fate in the more radical governments that soaked migrants up like bloody sponges.\n\nAnd so the unit was surprised when, after some hours of negotiation, the Red Army representative was escorted out of the Presidium with only a curt promise to 'consider' the annexation. It seemed to defy all common sense to treat their future administrators so poorly - and worse, it indicated an attitude of active defiance towards the Red Guards, something which seemed almost unthinkable in the face of overwhelming military superiority. Perhaps this was a simple fit of pique before the reality set in?\n\nIt was a far, far greater surprise when the unit was woken in the middle of the night by armed convoys expelling them post-haste from Oyrotia. The grim-faced militiamen had little to say to the soldiers, but their commander offered only a salute and a single phrase.\n\n"We will die free."\n\nAs the Guards retreated from the territory, the faint smell of gunpowder followed them, and with it the faint echo of yelling. Oyrotia would stand alone, if only for its last struggle."

PRC.22.desc: "Balances of power are rarely upset with ease: governments derive their stability from entrenched dynamics that take time and effort to change, even in the best of times. So it was for the Svobodny Presidium - although many stood defiant against the Generals, few could agree on what would fill the void left in their absence. The Mongolian-dominated civilian legislature struggled in vain to push their military counterparts into reform, and the Russian military apparatus contended with itself over the old questions of reform and orthodoxy. Neither was strong enough to push the other out, nor weak enough to be shattered entirely by intrigue or effort.\n\nSo it seemed the balance that defined the People's Revolutionary Council would stay as unchanging as the mountains - and yet even the mountains can tremble, and the seas give way, to forces greater than those which gave them birth.\n\nThe Extraordinary Congress, as it will subsequently be known, begins with Sergei Korolev. The firebrand technocrat has never hidden his disgust for the unstable state of the Presidium, or his beliefs regarding the poor condition of the People's Revolutionary Council's scientific and engineering facilities, but in a well-publicised speech to the Presidium he focuses his attacks on the politicians behind them both. In incendiary tones he accuses Russian and Mongolian factional leaders of guiding the country to destruction by their failure to commit to Mongolia or Russia. He calls them traitors to the mandate of the People's Revolutionary Council itself. In fact, it is hard to tell if there is anything he does not call them - or, as the speech grows ever more intense, their mothers and wives.\n\nThe effect, as must surely have been intended, has been to destroy the semblance of unity between the Presidium's factions. As order collapses in the Government, the senior councilors are faced with a choice: side with the Russian military - or the Mongolian people?"

For a moment he sits half-huddled, the blanket around his waist, watching the squad around what remains of the campsite and counting off: Edigu, Tudan, Slava, the Officer. Then the old Academy training kicks into gear; he's barking orders, rousing his men one by one in a frenzy. He casts worried glances at the hulk of half-painted steel behind them, mentally counting off steps, rehearsing. The exercise is nearing its final stage.\n\nThe men, still grumbling, push the Beast - Bankhar, Tudan calls it - forward in a lumbering track, its wheels leaving thick imprints behind it. Zaytsev leads them forward, checking the newfound compass and the occasional stirrings of the radio for signs of activity. The world slips away in the endless rhythm of push, push, push, like a struggling midwife in endless delivery.\n\nThen, in a stroke of mercy, the Officer calls for a halt - they have found their firing position. Edigu and Tudan spring into action, loading blanks and aiming the Beast at pre-rehearsed co-ordinates, and Zaytsev mutters curses under his breath as he interprets the maps in his hands. One, then another, and then another shell is fired - and then, blessedly, it is over.\n\nAs Zaytsev summons his men to prepare for the withdrawal and the long trek back to base, the Officer smiles and gestures behind him. The young Sergeant turns, bewildered, and nearly drops to his knees: the dust is kicking up long trails behind the shiny new motor-trucks that now dot the horizon. And the men in them wave and smile, gesturing obscenely: if Zaytsev could touch them now, he'd have tried to kiss them on the lips."

Valentina holds back his vomit. He can't stop, not here, not now.

Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons - a sob escapes him, a wild animal ripping its way out of his heart. And then another.\n\nHe struggles forward, hunching over in wild grief, even now searching for an answer, for his God to come as in Elijah's day to save the lost. As outlines surround him, he prays for the Savior in white-clad robes to restore the Old Church, just as in the times of Nikon the Schismatic.

And so he recognizes, almost immediately, that he's in a district just south of the mouth of the Ob River - and that this warehouse is different, almost military-grade polish and cordite. In fact, Suchkov suspects this kidnapping looks like - well - an inside job. Perhaps one of Glinka's flyboys has commandeered this depot?\n\nHe sneezes as the cloth-bag is pulled off his head, snorting out the rough fiber - god, the city can be filthy sometimes - and then he's looking into the slightly upturned smile of Boleslaw. He barely keeps his voice level. "I take it you're the person responsible for this. Release me. I'm with the Bureau, you know."\n\nBoleslaw's smile is level and cold.

It is also the single biggest source of illegal income in the Republic. And when a big enough barrel is offered - the pork will flow uninvited.\n\nIt is dark as the Party representative steps onto the dock, its wooden planks creaking with age.

The press is quick to catch on, and quickly accusations begin to spread of something bigger than an individual smuggling ring. Who is involved? To be more accurate, who is not involved?\n\nAs the civility of democracy strains and tears itself, police investigations into the Kargasoksky Fishing Company prove inconclusive. The crate itself - and many others found in the Modernist ring - bear the logo of this company, but there is no commercial or taxable evidence of its existence. Worse, it is as if all those who worked with the company wore shrouds while doing so, as witnesses recall next to nothing about their mysterious partners.

Well, perhaps not even that - even the rankest fool can understand that the attack would have to come from the right itself, to immobilize this open row before my queen can break out."\n\n"Ah, you and your combined operations claptrap. In this case swiftness, not strategy, is what is required - and I might add that it is showing promise in the wide-open strategic environment of the Steppes-"\n\n"Truly the Academy has taught you nothing! Those wide open environments speak not to the promise of mobile-infantry thrusts, but to the success of combined-arms pushes. If you'd paid attention to the Academy and not Skirt-Chasing Advanced Module, perhaps you'd have understood that...""

PRC.35.desc: "Night. The Mongolian steppes are steeped from horizon to horizon in that dark blanket, and below the bowl of heaven the sons and daughters of Kyzyl settle around campfires, cooking, talking and trying to sleep. The heavens have cleared of the sound of rifle-fire and artillery. For now, a kind of peace reigns.\n\nNo such peace around one beacon in the night, however. A platoon sits huddled around the embers of a cooking-fire, waiting for the fuel to run dry - and talking the dangerous talk. The Commissar left three days ago to carry orders from Command. There is no risk of retaliation or blowback - by common agreement the Commissar will meet with blank stares and curled lips when he returns, just as it was when he left.\n\nNo one knows when the first voice admits, in a reedy voice, that the war has not developed to their advantage. The radio sings of victories in distant parts of the front, but somehow these victories are always against heroic odds and end in sacrifice - and they are moving slowly backwards, as if dream-walking back into the homeland, week by week, month by month.\n\nWhat everyone comes to realize, in the long hours that follow, is that no one can find a compelling counter. For some reason the same failures that haunted the Army last year are being repeated, over and over, as if some strange playbook is being read to the letter in the issuing of every directive. The same offensives, the same entrenchments, the same defeats.\n\nAnd the inevitable conclusion to this, of course, is that the Red Army itself is doomed to certain defeat if it continues. Here the discussion ends, for there are some things even soldiers cannot bear to believe, but it hangs well into the night. The silence that descends whispers of distant thunder and a coming storm."

Morning is coming to Mongolia.\n\nThe company standing watch over the small town awaits its orders in the morning. Even here, far behind the frontline, there is work to be done: the village's water wells must be cleared, the market checked for suspicious items, the home of old Bilguun checked for what appears to be some kind of infestation. Always there is work, and with it, purpose. Names are read in the rudimentary barracks, patrols deployed, billets issued.\n\nMen and the occasional woman laugh and joke in the manner of all young people, sharing tea and treats with the children who run up to them. There is no harm in sharing, especially since combat rations would be intolerable in any other circumstance. The children, at least, are enamoured. And adorable.\n\nOld Bilguun watches the patient Red Army Guardsmen as they take apart the old cellar he always had trouble with, and for the first time he wonders if they will stay, after the great struggle they speak of has concluded. It is not an occupation, after all, if you truly do belong.\n\nOfficer Andreevich is busy studying the village's walls when the order comes. His face stiffens, and then he is busy barking orders to his command team. For the next day or so the Company moves into frenzied life, packing, repurposing and giving away what cannot be carried.\n\nBy the time dawn next touches Mongolia, the Company is gone."

Chief among those people was Tsedenbal - the Mongolian had never learnt the manners appropriate to a mere civilian. Now Tsedenbal and his cronies sat across his table, right in front of a map-exercise he'd just begun to plan. Had they no sense of propriety?\n\nStabbing the stub out on his chair, the old Russian leaned close. His hands trembled upon the lapels of his uniform as he straightened a loose collar.\n\n"And what is it I can offer you?"\n\nThe Mongolians offered thin-lipped smiles in return, saying nothing. Tsedenbal drew a dossier from his suit and nodded to him. Frowning, Vasilevsky flicked through the pages - his hands trembled ever more intensely as he reached the end of the brief document. A cold numbness settling upon his chest, the General paused to ensure what came next would fall with the appropriate impact.\n\n"I will not, and I will never, sanction the independence of our Mongolian deviationists. I care not if you are among them. I care not if the Devil himself is in your ranks. I. Will. Not. Approve."\n\nHis heart racing like the rush to Moscow had never ended, he sat back. The Mongolians looked to him, faces unchanged - they'd been expecting this. Tsedenbal rubbed his temples, suddenly far older in appearance, and then he spoke:"

Instead they busy themselves with civilian affairs, acting as a kind of intermediary between the Red Army and the Russians who have settled in this remote part of the old Union. Their work is endless, and it is often thankless, but it is a quiet joy of Getman to serve, and so his joy has become the duty and pride of his Command team.\n\nGetman is finishing his latest report on food availability in the trading communes near Kyzyl as the Committee approaches. His smile dims a little at the sight. He enjoys talking with Russians, but the Committee for the Preservation of All-Russian Unity is a counterargument for ever leaving his office, and their pinched faces don't help. He forces a smile nonetheless, greeting the members by name: Grigori, Matlovich, Semyon...\n\nThey don't ever let him finish, because why would they? He's nothing more than a glorified paper-pusher to them, and by God do they insist on pushing today. Their topic of concern, however, is entirely new even to the General.\n\nFor the first time the Russians ask not about the privileging of Mongolians to civilian positions in the Politburo, nor about the constant shortages of vital fuel supplies to Russian businesses, but about the fate of the nation itself. They demand an answer to the Mongolian question - Matlovich goes so far as to call the Mongolians "aliens" - and they begin to inquire about the selective silence of Vasilevsky.\n\nThis silence, they say, is premeditated. But who knows what the old General is thinking - or if he is thinking of Russia at all?"

As it stands now, the unrest is low level and mostly just the grumbling of some lower officers and enlisted men."\n\n"In the interest of the continued cohesion of the PRC it is this officer's recommendation that one of two courses of action should be taken. Either the Council should grant concessions to the mongolian contingent in order to calm their complaints, or there should be a concerted effort to crack down on and neuter the power of the mongolian contingent."\n\n"Whatever the choice, it is imperative that they are put into motion as soon as possible to prevent open conflict between the Red Army garrison and the Mongolian contingent."\n\nMarshal Vasilievsky leaned back in his chair and made up his mind."

As they marched, civilians hurried away from them and into their homes and units broke off to their areas of operation.\n\nAll across the city of Kyzyl troops from the garrison spread out and closed in on their targets. The building unrest between the factions of the People's Revolutionary Council had boiled over into an all out crackdown on the dissident faction.\n\nA squad of soldiers broke into the homes of dissidents and dragged them into the streets to be loaded into trucks. Occasionally, gunshots could be heard as the dissidents fought back and refused to be arrested.\n\nThankfully, the operation was a success with few casualties on either side.

Socialism is never beaten, right, Comrade?" His smile and optimism were forced, a broken man desperately trying to breathe life into his own cause.\n\nOleg tossed his cigarette into the snow, an angry scowl stretched across his weathered and leathery face. "There is no next time, Oldaghar. We lost, we had the piss beaten out of us by some Japanese puppet armed with peasants and hand-me-down equipment. What makes you think we'll ever be in a position to try again?"\n\n"But, Comrade," Oldaghar protested, pain smeared across his round face.\n\n"No, Oldaghar, and I mean this with respect, Mongolia is lost. We came here to take back Russia, not some other country." Oleg winced at his own words, unable to stop them as they poured out of his mouth.

If we are to ever make a play at reuniting the USSR we will have to be united in purpose.\n\nA proposal has come across the desk of the Marshal, to infiltrate and purge the Mongolian faction in order to neuter their influence. It would be a dangerous operation, fraught with risks to the PRC as a whole. More than that, it would be a betrayal of our staunchest allies since the fall of the Union.\n\nThe Marshal weighed his options, to approve the operation and risk dividing the PRC or to have them stand down and make the reunification all that more out of reach.

His stride lengthened as he sped up, he tried to look calm while he did so but his nerves were starting to get to him.\n\nVasily did not let himself feel any sort of calm until he strode up to the door of the commander's office. When he was let in, the garrison commander took the documents directly to Marshal Vasilevsky. Vasily returned to the barracks and flopped onto his cot. Laying on the uncomfortable cot he could not help but reminisce about his home city of Perm. He hoped that one day he would finally be able to return, after the PRC would finally get its act together. Soon enough, he had slipped off into a fitful sleep.\n\nThe next morning, the barracks were abuzz with the voices of soldiers. To his ears it seemed like they were gossiping about something. Blearily, he sat up and was just awake enough to not fall over as his friend Kvetoslav thrust a newspaper into his hands.

He was frogmarched out into the cold morning weather and forced into the bed of a truck filled with other Mongolian officers.\n\nThey drove for a couple hours before they were forced out of the truck and inside an unknown building. When the bag was finally removed, Asugbal could see he was in a cell of some sort with five other members of the Mongolian officer corps.\n\nThe men who had thrown them into the cell shouted out charges of sedition and espionage and informed them that they had been sent to a prison in the mountains of Tuva. They would remain there until the PRC was satisfied.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kyzyl, Mongolian political forces that had avoided the purge itself were allowed to remain on as representatives of the Mongolian population, but in truth their influence had been destroyed."

Negotiation from a position of strength in such a situation was difficult, almost comically so, but the seasoned veteran of both the battlefield and the politics of the former USSR was up for the challenge. With one resolved sigh, Vasilevsky opened the door.\n\n"Comrade Vasilevsky," greeted the seated Jamiyangiin Lkhagvasuren, the grey eminence of the Mongolian faction, one amongst a cluster of uniformed and suited Mongol communists.\n\n"Comrade Jamiyangiin ," answered Vasilevsky, meeting the Mongol's heavy gaze with his own. "I must apologize for the unfortunate series of events that have led to this meeting. I hope that we can put the past behind us." Jamiyangiin's expression was less than forgiving, but Vasilevsky continued on. "My staff and I have drafted up an agreement for our two factions intended to ease tensions and includes us both in the future of Mongolia and Russia."\n\nJamiyangiin took the proffered paper and he and his council began to pour over the details.

Apparently the Black Army had been paying its members in angst. One of them, a boy no more than sixteen, stuck his tongue out at his minder, murmuring a curse word like a schoolkid denied his milk. Jesus, how had the Army survived long enough to surrender to Kyzyl?\n\nIvanovich noticed the swaying branches, diffuse moonlight spreading through the gaps of the treeline. A stifled giggle to his left, and he swiveled on instinct to - a girl playing shadow puppets with a younger girl, perhaps a sister or family friend. The child burbled, grasping at the hands of the laughing elder. Ivanovich had lost his mother at a young age. He lacked the vocabulary to describe the precise hollowness that shook his heart, just as a man born blind cannot describe color. Even so, it was there, like a quiet punch to the gut that kept on punching.\n\nHere and there a ragged chant arose, the song of children in all times and places - a song with no real meaning and all the meaning in the world. Ivanovich stayed stiffly silent, checking the bushes for telltale gunbarrels, and gently swaying in the night breeze. Like a route march, he told himself. This was just like a route-march.\n\nA nudge in the side, and Ivanovich jerked awake. A boy half his age, ten at the most, stretched his palm towards him. In his hand was a small ball. The boy mimed putting something in his mouth, and Ivanovich followed, almost immediately regretting it. Thoughts of poison, however, were almost immediately dispelled - herbal sweetness filled his mouth. Some kind of supplement, perhaps?\n\nReaching to thank the boy, Ivanovich was met with the first smile he'd seen in weeks, the first since he'd walked into the damned territory of the Siberian Black Army. Tears filled his eyes, and a gentle warmth suffused the moonlit air, still beautiful in that brimless night."

Here and there the traces of a dozen different scripts outlined troop compositions and infrastructure estimates, jostling for space on an already crowded map. The result was distinctly unattractive - a squiggly labyrinth of information, numbers, words in Russian, Mongolian and even Japanese all crammed into a coffee-table.\n\nHe sighed. It was the best estimate they had on what the Politburo was already calling the Hermit Kingdom. The Kingdom of the House of Rurik, run by a madman and staffed by would-be heroes. A kingdom of unions and of bureacurats, one which made not the slightest pretense to divinity and yet seemed almost religious in its support base. And now it was their problem to deal with, just as Chita had been all those years ago.\n\nHis military advisors had already briefed him, of course, on the strategic realities of the strange little monarchist aberration. The Kingdom, for all its bluster, had little diplomatic support for its activities, and its neighbours were, well, distant at best. There would be no aid coming for the Council's forces if it should intervene in Kemorovo, but there would be no hindrance, either.\n\nVasilevsky reached for a picture of the vaunted Royal Family, his brows furrowing. The smiling figures of Rurik and his daughter seemed almost alien in their gowns, so removed from the monotone palette of uniform-green and khaki of Vasilevsky's world. He scowled and left it aside - no matter how alien the Kingdom was, it was close enough for a decision to be made."

Anton could hardly restrain himself from ordering a recess to chase these refugees away from the Courthouse - according to the papers he had in front of him, these sorry folks were all that was left of the rulers of Kemorovo, and they were to be accorded as much dignity as could be conferred.\n\nAnton slapped his podium, calling the Court to order. A list of charges was brought before the King, who had to be dragged to his position by struggling guards - the jury giggled, as if watching a cabaret, and scattered applause arose when he demanded to speak. Those giggles died as Rurik began to speak not in the tones of a madman or a court jester, but in the reasoned tones of an officer or bureaucrat.\n\nRurik now spoke of the need of Russia for the guidance of an enlightened despot, and waved his fist in airy sweeps as he pointed to where armed forces had gotten the Revolutionary Council. Here and there he lowered his tones to speak as if to individual members of the crowd, almost seductive in his intensity, and then he raised his voice in a theatrical crescendo. The waves and troughs of emotion swept the jury, awestruck - it was as if they had seen to the gold-flecked bottom of a muddy pool. As Rurik bowed, his speech concluded, they cheered.\n\nAnton, in mounting confusion and dismay, called for a halt to proceedings. Rurik might have been a madman, but it was clear that he was far from harmless. In heated discussion with Red Army officers, Anton decided a new way forward was needed - jail would no longer be sufficient for the man who would-be King."

There was no mention of leniency for his children, no matter how much he begged and pleaded - the Revolutionary Council is evidently not in a merciful frame of mind. Not that he can blame them, either. Krylov is an old vestige of an unpleasant past for the new world that the Mongolians are birthing here.\n\nIt is only natural for the new to be more extreme than the old.\n\nGunshots in the hallway outside, screams muffled.

Now, it appears, the crimes of the past have come to haunt us. Perhaps the Buddhist monks in their little camp are right, and history does spin in great cycles: yesterday's traitors, tomorrow's menaces, all refracted images in splintered glass.\n\nWell, even if that is true, it does not excuse inaction. Nikolai and his gang, holed up in the rat-den of Krasnoyarsk, poses a threat even in their weakened state: our armies are strong and our revolutionary will undeniable, but the armies of the so-called Democrats claim a strength of their own. The ideals of Andreev have a poisonous appeal to them, and if imbibed long enough they give a zeal that is entirely otherworldly - who knew meaningless freedoms could pack such a punch?\n\nIf the Buddhists are right about one thing, however, it is that history turns in cycles on the just and unjust alike. Then, as now, the Krasnoyarsk Republic is alone; then, as now, the true Soviets stand in silent judgement, our strength a statement as to the real power of Soviet Socialism. All that remains will be to crush these libertines as we have crushed all other false idealists in our own camp.\n\nThat said, some argue that a gentler approach will keep the Andreevites at bay, and that leaving them alone will trigger an inevitable collapse as their ideals falter. After all, their desire to reach the Pacific is foolhardy at best - and near impossible with the armies massed near their position. Perhaps it would be best to let the dream die untouched?"

Bodies of his comrades lie around the ruins of the two story house, the last bastion of the Krasnoyarsk rebels, dust and gunsmoke thick in the air.\n\nNikolai hunched over, keeping low as the Council troops entered, weapons drawn. After the six hour firefight, Nikolai had hoped to see far less of them standing. Such was his luck, he supposed. Nikolai sighed in resignation, hoping he could earn himself hard labor instead of execution if he went quietly.

With the dismantling of the conglomerates that ruled over its people, there exists a large population of workers friendly to our cause and a large industrial base from which to make use of.\n\nThe next option is the city of Krasnoyarsk. While not quite so large as Novosibirsk, it is still one of the crown jewels of Siberia and contains a large industrial base. Similarly, it lies on an extremely important junction of the Trans-Siberia railroad. Its position could lend us a key logistical advantage if we were to use it as our capital, similar in many ways to Moscow in the West.\n\nFinally, there is the city of Kemerovo. With the capture of the city from the mad "Tsar" Rurik II, we have gained access to the city at the confluence of the Iskitim and Tom rivers, major waterways in Central Siberia. While the city does not boast the same large population and industrial base as the other cities, its proximity to the Kuznets basin and its coal mines ensures its importance as an industrial center all on its own.\n\nUltimately, any of the three would make a good capital in the end.

You, soldiers of socialism, the Vanguard of the People, continue to safeguard the future of the Russian people."\n\nThe warriors of Siberia stood at attention, eyes fixed on their leader, hope burning in their hearts. "Freedom," continued Vasilevsky, "is something that must be earned in blood and lead, a harsh lesson that life on the steppe has taught us time and time again. There are those amongst us that cry out for democracy for a true Soviet, and it pains me that I cannot grant them such a thing. You, the soldiers of the USSR, are the guides to a blind populace that cannot see that it needs such guidance. The day will come for the Red Army to step down from its position of power, to return to the factories and the fields, to take their place amongst over proletarians." Vasilevsky swallowed, allowing his words to sink in for a moment, "but that is not today. This day, this glorious future, is what you fight for, and with the Russian people under your protection, it is achievable!" Applause roared through the air, a human equivalent to the engines of the Red Air Force. Vasilevsky smiled, that day would come."

PRC.67.t: "Civilian Victory!"
PRC.67.desc: "News from the recent conference on the powers of the Civilian base vs. Vasilevsky and the Army's status quo has come in. After thorough debates, many votes, and spirited discussion, it appears the Civilians have won the day. In a speech, the leader of the coalition has outlined a few changes that will be made with their victory. As expected, reform and civilian power are at the top or near top of the list, but the specifics are murky as of yet save for one particular sticking point.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a council of civilians will be established and subsequently convened to put checks on Vasilevsky's power within the PRC. This represents a great leap towards proper popular rule in our fair country, and many common folk have rejoiced at the prospect of having a stronger say in the goings on here. The army and Vasilevsky have accepted their defeat gracefully and continue to faithfully serve the country. Harmony between civilian and military power is yet another step towards our stabilization, and thus even those who have found their power at loss after the conference still look forward to a brighter future. "
PRC.67.a: "A step towards unity."

PRC.68.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nMilitary Victory!"
PRC.68.desc: "The primary meetings of the Revolutionary Council at the Krasnoyarsk Conference have concluded, with resultant political consolidation towards the continued influence of military authorities in the governmental structure.\n\nMaking the argument that although the Far East has been secured, enemies of the state both within and without continue to exist in large numbers, many council members agreed that a transition to civilian-led administration could not reasonably be entertained at this time. Speeches by several prominent figures subsequent to the decision reinforced this perception and position.\n\nAlthough many Council members are reportedly very disappointed by the decision, there is no indication of overt dissent among its members. Indeed, while such members may not have achieved their primary goal of civilian government, all agree that the choice was arrived at by legitimate debate, and must therefore be respected.\n\nIt is further expected that, should the state's military and security position improve, the debate will be revisited. Vigorously."

PRC.69.desc: "The primary meetings of the Revolutionary Council at the Krasnoyarsk Conference have concluded, with a resultant political shift towards the reduced influence of military authorities in the government and the empowerment of civilian institutions.\n\nMaking the argument that despite the state's many enemies both within and without, it was critical to elevate civilian authorities to properly administer the vast new territories acquired, many council members agreed that a transition to civilian-led administration was required. Speeches by several prominent figures subsequent to the decision reinforced this perception and position.\n\nAlthough many senior military figures are reportedly very disappointed by the decision, there is no indication of overt dissent among its members. Indeed, though they may harbor concerns about transfers of power, all agree that the choice was arrived at by legitimate and uncoerced debate, and must therefore be respected.\n\nIt is, however, expected that if the security situation was to suddenly change, the debate would be revisited. Vigorously."
PRC.69.a: "Civilian leadership will bring us forward."

PRC.70.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nNo Clear Victor?"
PRC.70.desc: "The meetings of the Revolutionary Council at the Krasnoyarsk Conference have continued, with no clear victory in sight for supporters of either the military or civilian factions.\n\nThe near-deadlock has been observed to have caused considerable discord, with both civilian- and military-aligned representatives at times accusing others of purposeful obstructionism, and on several occasions has nearly escalated to physical confrontation.\n\nNeither faction feels that their position has been respected by the other, neither faction feels that their requirements for compromise have been met by the other, and neither faction believes that the position of the other is strong enough to forcibly secure the resolution of many questions of import.\n\nAlthough no overt incidents have been reported as of yet, all in attendance are aware that tension lies heavy, that the aggression of members frustrated at the impasse is growing, and that the slightest disturbance could potentially lead to events spiralling out of control."
PRC.70.a: "The military has had enough! Soldiers enter the chamber and begin shooting!"
PRC.70.b: "Determined to reach a resolution, the civilian delegates continue debate."

PRC.71.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nMilitary Intervention!"
PRC.71.desc: "Incensed at the deadlock of the Krasnoyarsk Conference, a number of military units stationed in the city moved to establish control over the buildings containing the feuding delegates. The source of their orders, or even the knowledge if such orders existed in the first place, is unclear.\n\nShots were reported from within the Council chambers themselves, and in the spaces outside violent confrontations were observed between crowds of civilian supporters and the invading soldiers. Numerous deaths and injuries have been reported.\n\nSimilar disorder extended throughout Krasnoyarsk over the day and well into the night, with further clashes between civilian and military units all over the city. It is unknown who, if any, is in overall command of the military units involved or if the measures taken were those of disgruntled subordinates acting in decentralized fashion.\n\nAnarchy has overtaken the conference, and it is not yet known how, once effective command has been clarified, the military will ultimately respond to the developing situation."
PRC.71.a: "The die has been cast. The military pushes on to secure direct control."
PRC.71.b: "The military pulls back, and re-opens negotiations with the civilians."

PRC.72.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nMilitary Cements Control!"
PRC.72.desc: "Following the restoration of centralized command to the military units involved in insurrection, the military has successfully managed to secure both the chambers of the Revolutionary Council as well as the delegates in attendance.\n\nThe way forward, as directed by their central command, was clear. Through the absolute inability of the Council to achieve consensus or compromise within a reasonable time frame, they announced, the Council has proven the weakness of civilian government, and with many enemies of the state existing in all spheres, such weakness could not be entertained.\n\nTherefore, and at the direction of the military's supporters on the Council to their dissenting former confederates, a decision was imposed: the military will retain control of the state's government until such time as it decides otherwise.\n\nIn time, perhaps and with ultimate state victory both within and without, they may entertain a transition back to civilian leadership. They may rescind part of their absolute control.\n\nOr they may not."
PRC.72.a: "The military was, and will remain, the legitimate government."

PRC.73.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nMilitary Continues Action!"
PRC.73.desc: "The failure of the initial units involved in the insurrection against the Revolutionary Council to secure total control was a costly failure, and one that must now be addressed.\n\nSome members of that Council, specifically those opposed to continued military rule, have called for the Krasnoyarsk citizenry to rise against the military units in rebellion, and several smaller detachments were overrun before they could be consolidated. It is clear that time for the military is running out, and that it must take decisive action if it is to emerge victorious.\n\nThose in command were advised by several junior officers that they make one concerted effort, with what forces they have remaining, to overrun the Council's defenses and establish physical control of them before the civilians organize further - or before other officers started having second thoughts.\n\nIf they can do so, they can potentially emerge triumphant. The alternative is unknown."
PRC.73.a: "The military is committed. They push forward, whatever the cost."
PRC.73.b: "The military believes it does not have the strength. It pulls back."

PRC.74.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nThe Military Collapses!"
PRC.74.desc: "In a surprising turn of events, civilian militias within Krasnoyarsk have managed to utterly defeat the attempted military insurrection targeting the Revolutionary Council.\n\nFollowing an initial failure to capture the buildings and persons of the Council, spontaneous civilian formations overran a number of smaller military units, and prevented further advance. A brief period of consolidation on the part of the military followed, before a renewed and concentrated offensive by their remaining forces commenced.\n\nHowever, that offensive failed as well in the face of stiff and even more numerically overwhelming civilian resistance. In addition, civilian anger at the events resulted in a decentralized assault on military positions which, against all odds, succeeded, with numerous senior officers killed and even more arrested and turned over to authorities that remained loyal to the Council.\n\nThe full extent of the outcomes of these events are not yet clear, but whatever they may be, they will not entertain the views or desires of the military. In any fashion."
PRC.74.a: "A most unexpected outcome."

PRC.75.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nCivilian-Military Détente!"
PRC.75.desc: "Following several days of violence between military units and civilian militias in and around Krasnoyarsk and the Revolutionary Council, cooler heads prevailed, and representatives of both factions subsequently agreed to meet in order to prevent further disorder.\n\nAt that meeting, all agreed that an escalation of violence would not be in the best interests of the state, and that a mutually agreeable solution needed to be found before the fragile truce established was disrupted and further conflict was made inevitable. Luckily, after much debate and negotiation, such a solution was found.\n\nThe military units involved in the insurrection would disarm, calming fears of a complete military takeover, while the civilian authorities would, in the future, carefully consider the position and concerns of the military in regards to important decisions.\n\nThis was seen by all to be the most reasonable outcome possible, as while the military has been given a new appreciation for the power and motivation of the citizenry, so too has that same citizenry learned to understand the determination and destructive potential of the military when turned against them."
PRC.75.a: "A peaceful outcome, by the narrowest of margins."

PRC.76.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nCivilian Pressure is Applied!"
PRC.76.desc: "Despite earlier tensions, peaceful debate has, so far, prevailed within the Revolutionary Council. This may not be the case for much longer.\n\nMilitary representatives, as well as Council representatives sympathetic to them, have grown more agitated and irritated than even before, and their displeasure threatens to disrupt the fragile equilibrium that has so far been maintained. One such military officer, in particular, has taken to loudly denouncing every proposal by the bloc of civilian representatives, threatening to 'take action' if solutions and agreements are not forthcoming.\n\nEmboldened, however, one civilian representative, around whom support and unofficial leadership has coalesced, has risen to combat the officer, presenting rebuttals to each of his statements. Though this has resulted in the continued relevance of his views, it has also acted to incense the officer even further.\n\nThings are coming to a head, and the civilian delegate has to make a choice about how he plans to respond to the officer's latest incendiary remarks and gestures."
PRC.76.a: "The civilian delegate waits to see what happens."
PRC.76.b: "Incensed, the civilian delegate begins issuing threats of his own."

PRC.77.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nA Sudden Attack!"
PRC.77.desc: "The decision by the civilian leader to wait has led to a tragic outcome, both for the state and for the physical health of many representatives to the Revolutionary Council.\n\nThe military officer's anger and frustration at the continued impasse within the Council soon reached a zenith, and activating an object inside his uniform, summoned a group of soldiers to invade the chamber. As the representatives protested and demanded their removal, the officer refused, and commanded the soldiers to begin firing upon the civilian members. They obeyed.\n\nA number of the representatives were immediately killed, and others began running for cover in attempts, sometimes vain, to save themselves. Among them was the civilian leader himself, who realized that, unless he took action, the soldiers would kill everyone in the room, and impose whatever they wanted in the aftermath.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he prepared to shout out commanding directions to his fellow representatives."
PRC.77.a: "He marshals the Council representatives to charge the soldiers!"
PRC.77.b: "He orders the Council representatives to scatter and hide."


PRC.78.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nCivilian Recovery!"
PRC.78.desc: "The civilian leader's order to scatter and hide proved prescient, as while the invading soldiers did have weapons, what they did not have was numbers. Or time.\n\nScattering across both the Council chambers and the buildings beyond, the civilian representatives managed, despite several tragic exceptions, to avoid the soldiers' best efforts to find and kill them. The also managed to, once sure of their safety, rally supporters and loyal military and police to conduct a counterattack.\n\nRapidly overwhelming the dispersed soldiers, they quickly moved, the civilian leader at their head, to retake the Council chamber, disarming and arresting the last few soldiers, and arresting the military officer who had summoned them besides.\n\nWith the sudden violent insurrection just as suddenly defeated, the representatives of the Revolutionary Council reclaimed their seats, including those still slick with blood, and prepared to make their decisions of the future of the state.\n\nAnd this time, there would be no debate."
PRC.78.a: "The civilians move to secure permanent political dominance."

PRC.79.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nCivilian Dominance!"
PRC.79.desc: "Following the quick actions of the civilian representatives in the Revolutionary Council, and the defeat of the sudden military insurrection, they moved rapidly to accomplish their reforms.\n\nReclaiming their seats, some still slick with the blood of their contemporaries, they immediately expelled the few members who, somehow, still held pro-military sympathies, and voted to establish a legal quorum. They then presented, and passed through unanimous acclaim, a long list of reforms to the state's political framework.\n\nCivilian leadership, at all levels and in all functions of government, was enshrined. The military was specifically detailed as existing in a wholly subordinate capacity to civilian authority, and a national command structure was established to reinforce such a policy. Many of the most aggressive and hawkish military officers, senior or otherwise, were immediately cashiered.\n\nThe result was clear, and immediate - total civilian dominance of the political spectrum. What discussion did not end, rash and violent action quickly did."
PRC.79.a: "The decision was made for them."

PRC.80.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nBloodshed in the Council!"
PRC.80.desc: "Although the civilian leader's direction of the representatives to charge the soldiers invading the Revolutionary Council was certainly brave, it was just as certainly monumentally foolish.\n\nThe leader himself was the first to fall, shot through the head, and many of the others quickly learned what so many others had during the state's unification of the Far East: that unarmed civilians are no real match for automatic weapons. The charge faltered almost as quickly as it had begun, and the survivors quickly fell back into whatever cover they could find.\n\nThe braver among them called out for instructions, unaware in the chaos that their leader had fallen and, hearing none in reply, began to despair. What could they do? How could they continue to resist? Throughout the chamber these questions were asked by the representatives to each other through knowing glances, exchanged from desperate huddles behind improvised cover.\n\nAfter a few moments the shooting slowed, and the military officer began calling for the representatives to surrender. That they had no chance of resistance. Of victory. Of life, if they continued their futile actions. Both individually, and as a one, the civilians considered their next action."
PRC.80.a: "The civilians surrender to the soldiers."
PRC.80.b: "The civilians are determined to fight!"

PRC.81.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nMilitary Assumes Authority!"
PRC.81.desc: "With the surrender of the surviving civilian representatives of the Revolutionary Council to the military officer and his soldiers, decisive control by the military faction has been achieved.\n\nAlready the surviving pro-military representatives have usurped the mission of the Council in order to enshrine military involvement in state government at nearly every level and in most decision-making processes. With the civilian representatives under arrest, there exists no figures of authority to oppose these movements, and it is expected that, despite their clear illegality, they will be accepted by most organs of state without significant protest.\n\nThough this assumption of power was, by all accounts, unplanned, spontaneous, and executed on the orders of a junior officer, it has nonetheless cemented the military's position in society both for now, and for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe removal of so many potential dissidents is simply an unexpected bonus. One that should not be wasted."
PRC.81.a: "The military has secured political supremacy."

PRC.82.t: "The Krasnoyarsk Conference:\nMilitary Backs Down!"
PRC.82.desc: "Although internally, the civilian leader was aware of how dangerous it was for him to respond to the military officer's threats with threats of his own, he successfully kept a calm demeanour, despite the worried glances of his contemporaries.\n\nHe, and all others present, had watched the officer and their associates closely, waiting to see how they would respond. At first, they were quiet, seemingly stunned by the civilian leader's audacity. Then, they were angry, the officer's hands moving towards some object in his jacket.\n\nAnd then, after another long and tension-filled moment, they all seemed to deflate, looking at each other with knowing glances. The officer sat down, his body language far less confrontational. Although the civilians did not understand just what had happened, they could tell that some critical decision had been made - in their favor.\n\nSeizing the moment, the civilian leader sat down as well, and offered a small concession to the officer. Proper negotiation towards a balanced government could now continue, and he was willing to surrender on a small issue in order to advance them further."
PRC.82.a: "A dangerous gamble. But a successful one."

PRC.83.t: "Planning the Krasnoyarsk Conference"
PRC.83.desc: "With the state having now secured control over the entire region, it is now time to address the critical question of its future governance.\n\nThough we have operated under a military government for many years, we no longer face the same challenges that we once did. Some issues have been resolved, while other, far larger ones have surfaced. Of all of these issues, the primary one involves how the state's administrations should be organized.\n\nMany within the military believe that their administration should continue, albeit in a scaled-up manner, until such time as the nation is fully reunified. Others, however, especially those from recently-pacified lands with civilian administrations, have insisted that a civilian-led government is the only rational way forward, and they are supported by many figures within our own state organs.\n\nA civilian government, they argue, is the only institution that can adequately address the myriad of domestic issues facing us, and would, furthermore, free up military attention towards the campaigns to come. These arguments can no longer be ignored.\n\nWe are therefore organizing a meeting of the Revolutionary Council to be held in Krasnoyarsk, in the near future. Representatives of both civilian interests as well as the military will attend. There, this issue will be debated, and a conclusive answer will be reached as to how our state will move forward to the next stage of its existence.\n\nOne way or the other, this issue will be resolved."
PRC.83.a: "An answer will be decided upon."

PRC.84.t: "The Trial: Decision Required"
PRC.84.desc: "From his protected position, Alexander Vasilevsky closely watched the proceedings of the trial below.\n\nKostin and his confederates in revolt, or those that had been captured alive stood below, on trial for their crimes. The proceedings were long, with motions introduced by legal officials on either side, but all, including Vasilevsky, knew that there was only one outcome. Traitors could not, would not, be declared innocent.\n\nNo, the only question was what the sentence for their crimes was to be. Though the judge would proclaim that sense, Vasilevsky himself would be the one who determined it. And he had much to consider. Different factions within his state each had a different opinion.\n\nMost civilians, both in and out of government, believed that they should all be executed, a serious sentence being logically applied to a serious crime, one which threatened the very foundation and existence of the state. Many within the military, however, perhaps considering old sympathies or friendships, or seeing potential future value, felt that they should be spared death and instead given prison sentences of indeterminate length.\n\nVasilevsky was not sure how to proceed. Death solved the problem decisively, but could cause problems with the military that he replied upon. Simple prison, however, could cause domestic unrest. A third option, he realized, could be to spare them death, but modify their prison sentences to ones of hard labor, placating the military while avoiding accusations of undue leniency.\n\nRegardless, he would have to make a choice. And soon."
PRC.84.a: "Death is the only possible reward for treason."
PRC.84.b: "Prison sentences will suffice."
PRC.84.c: "Hard Labor will serve as a reasonable compromise."

PRC.85.t: "The Greater Good"
PRC.85.desc: "Major Ilariy Kovalev listened to the assembly's complaints for an hour straight without a single interruption. Unlike his colleagues, Kovalev was patient with the civilian bureaucracy. Even with all the red tape one had to cut through. Strangely to Kovalev, the voices had become polarized in opposite directions. With the conquest of the rest of Siberia, many warlords had come under the wing of the People's Revolutionary Council. No longer was it one lone army allied with steppe peoples, but a serious contender to unite the nation under the ideals of the October Revolution. Unfortunately, the ideological drift of the different Russian polities had created such intense zealotry that even now, defeated, Siberia was awash with civil disobedience and outright terrorism.\n\n"These traitors must be hunted down. Every rat must be forced out into the light and crushed. I thought you military men knew how to get it done," A young firebrand Mongol shouted at Major Kovalev, stabbing his finger at a report of a railway line being sabotaged by counter-revolutionary elements. "It was a miracle the train didn't derail and end in thousands of deaths!"\n\nHaving saved all his energy for this moment, Kovalev levelled a powerful stare at the young man. His voice was a bassy rumble that shook the room. "With all due respect, the proposal for dealing with these acts is nothing short of medieval. Forced resettlement, summary executions... These collective punishments will only alienate people who have come under our protection. Not everyone is at fault for the actions of these few actors. If we are to one day extend our borders to the breadth and width of Russia, we cannot lower ourselves to such base punitive measures. Even if it costs us." Of course his answer didn't soothe the civilians, but it did dull their bloodthirsty perspective."
PRC.85.a: "Thankfully these two sides can discuss this matter in the open, as equals."

PRC.86.t: "War Councilism"
PRC.86.desc: "The men of the 14th People's Revolutionary Squadron sat around the campfire, full of a distinct aura as the men tried to ignore the spaces where their fallen comrades usually sat. Gone were the days of laughter and brotherhood. They had all lost someone, a friend, a mentor.\n\n"Now, I know casualties are always hard," said Dmitri, the officer, a more brazen young man than usual among the Red Army, "but losses always happen, it's a part of war."\n\nNikita, the more aged veteran of the Patriotic War, stood up, shouting "This time it was preventable, you're the one who gives the orders, and you're the one who's responsible for almost getting us encircled! We could have all died back there!"\n\n"My orders..." growled Dmitri, "were to hold your ground and fight. You cowards were the ones who ran into that ambush."\n\n"Even worse!" yelled Nikita, "If we had stayed, we would have been surrounded by an enemy five times our size! Face it, Dmitri, you're not made to be an officer. It's time we elect a new one. Field replacement is a core tenet of the Council, after all."\n\nDmitri sighed. "Fine, if you want a new officer, replace me. None of you know how to lead a dog, much less a squad of fifteen men. I'll be sure to remember this when I die of your stupidity.""
PRC.86.a: "15-1 for Nikita. Welcome to the officer corps."

PRC.87.t: "Along the Frontier"
PRC.87.desc: "As the borders of the state continued to expand, from that of the Mongolian hinterlands to, now, those far more westerly, it was inevitable that such encounters would occur.\n\nThe members of the military patrol were cosmopolitan. Their sergeant had followed the military campaigns all the way from Siberia, while many of the men were from towns and villages in more recent territorial integrations. The sergeant gave thanks for this, as it allowed him both to espouse his own experiences while also benefiting from the local knowledge the recruits possessed.\n\nKnowledge that served well when one of those recruits noticed another patrol, in the distance, observing them from a small hillock just across the frontier. The sergeant at first tightened his grip on the weapon he carried, and brought the binoculars to his face. He relaxed when he realized they were likely on the same mission as he.\n\nTheir states had met some time previously, and it was not yet certain what their subsequent interactions would be. Conflict or diplomacy? Nobody knew, except those at the very top. And they were not telling anyone their thoughts. To the men on the front lines, however, considerations were very different. They were just soldiers walking many miles, in desolate terrain, all in the name of security.\n\nSlowly, one of the men on the other patrol raised his arm, and waved. The sergeant, after a long moment, waved back. He might, in the future, be shooting at that man. But, at least for today, they were just two common soldiers, doing their mundane, if necessary, job."

No longer will lose bandits be able to wreak havoc on our supply lines, and decades-old parts of rail are being replaced and repaired.\n\nSoon, even more trains will be able to travel the tracks, improving our supply and industrial capabilities.

PRC.89.t: "Preparing for the Final Unification"
PRC.89.desc: "With the Far East now under our control, we have now unified almost all of Siberia. We grow more prepared for the final unification by the day, and if it comes down to the pen or the sword, we will be ready. The proletariat will be defended no matter the cost, and the Red Army will return home! Where we once were a small statelet in Mongolia, wracked by defeat and depression, we now have achieved our true destiny.\n\nIntegration of the Far East is still being handled of course, but our rule seems to be secure with the populace. We must now be sure to expand our industrial capabilities and ensure our entire military is well-armed. We cannot go without equipment, no matter what happens."
PRC.89.a: "We are prepared to face the West."

PRC.90.t: "The Focus of Our Economy"
PRC.90.desc: "After our conquest of Central Siberia over the reactionaries and the anarchists, we now have to sort out our budget. We have a whole new economy we need to administrate, and different industries need to be organized. We must sort the economy before we can even dream of national unification.\n\nWe have two options we could focus on. The first would be to prioritize civilian matters, more civilian industries, and infrastructure. While this would give us a powerful base and will surely be helpful in the future, many of our commanders argue that it would be a waste.\n\nInstead they assert the military should be prioritized because it is the most important for the conquest for Russian reunification. New military factories, production, and fortifications, they say, must be built to fully prepare us for the future.\n\nIt is a difficult decision, but we cannot balance both. What should we focus on?"

PRC.91.desc: "Momentous news today, as an American diplomat, along with their entourage, has arrived in our capital bearing a missive from their government. This missive makes it clear that they are to formally extend recognition to our government from that of the United States, and thereby commence official relations between us.\n\nMany within our administration consider this as excellent news, reflecting as it must the seriousness with which the United States, a major global power, considers our claims to national legitimacy. This may be true, but it is also a potential cause for concern. We have long upheld the ideals of the Red Army and of socialism, and as such other prominent officials have publicly stated that we must be vigilant for signs of capitalist subversion.\n\nAnd we will be. We have sacrificed too much and lost too many brave comrades to do anything but. The preeminent position of socialist ideals within our state must be protected, by any and all means possible. All organs of state will stand ready, as they always have, to combat any such subversion, should it be detected.\n\nHowever, and at least for now, we can take pride in the ever-increasing international perception of our government and the perception of its right to govern Russia as a whole."
PRC.91.a: "We must be cautious. But also aware of opportunity."

Division of the shipment has already begun, as elements of our military's quartermaster corps make decisions on which units receive which items.\n\nFurthermore, figures within the high command have already begun to propose the employment of these new weapons in the near future, in one of the myriad campaigns that our armed forces are sure to find themselves in.\n\nThough none can be sure as to whether their proposals will be heeded, all know that, at the very least, the state's soldiery is much better equipped to further them if desired."
PRC.92.a: "Distribute them immediately."

PRC.93.t: "Staffing Our Universities"
PRC.93.desc: "With our recent decision to reopen the universities of Central Siberia, we must decide who will be teaching the next generation of students. There are plenty of academics and intellectuals across our territory, and we could easily ask these men and women to work for us. Unfortunately, not everyone in Central Siberia agrees with our regime, and not everyone in Central Siberia agrees with our ideology.\n\nWhile each school's curriculum will be updated regardless, having ideologically divergent academics spreading their biases to their students could foment dissent within our populace. Many argue that intellectuals adhering to deviant ideologies must be purged, and kept far away from any impressionable pupils. Others argue that experienced academics are a precious resource, and that beggars can't be choosers. If we just ensure they have proper oversight, they argue, no problems should occur.\n\nRegardless of how much trust we have in these intellectuals, our universities will need professors if they are to reopen. We can either choose only professors dedicated to socialism and purge the rest, or ensure that the brightest minds of Siberia are employed, even if we may disagree on politics."
PRC.93.a: "Only universities must be staffed with the best and brightest Siberia has to offer."

PRC.94.desc: "Viktor had managed to avoid being drafted into the Republic's army when the communists had invaded, and now that they had reopened the universities, Viktor could pursue his education once more. Viktor had been a little nervous when the University of Tomsk had been covered head-to-toe in red flags and propaganda, worried that it was a sign for what's to come.\n\nViktor was surprised to see that Professor Abramov was still teaching Viktor's history course, considering the man didn't strike Viktor as much of a socialist. He quickly sat down in his seat as Abramov began his lecture, "Alright, class, this is our first time meeting since the universities reopened, so there's some administrative matters I have to review. First, as I'm sure you're all aware, the Central Siberian Republic is no more, and we now answer to the People's Revolutionary Council, who are now funding this university," Abramov looked especially unhappy after finishing that sentence, "Secondly, the curriculum has been updated. Your exam has been delayed to accommodate for the new material, and your final exam will no longer be cumulative. I'm sure you're all rather pleased about that development."\n\n"The final announcement I have before I begin my revised lecture is that we will be returning to a more in depth view of the late Russian Empire. Your papers regarding the consequences of the Second World War will not be graded. Apparently our new employers don't wish for you to learn about Bukharin's failures."\n\nViktor could tell Abramov wasn't very happy about any of these recent changes, but he gave the lecture anyway. The rest of Viktor's professors were less overtly negative, although some of them also weren't particularly enthusiastic about the new communist government."
PRC.94.a: "Um, does this mean Chapter 7 won't be on the exam, sir?"

PRC.95.t: "Intellectual Realignment"
PRC.95.desc: "The operation had been planned with military precision, and was designed to accomplish its goals in as little time, and with as much simultaneous effect, as possible. The intelligence of those it targeted demanded nothing less.\n\nFor they were the intelligentsia of the newly occupied territories. The state, in acquiring such vast new lands, was faced with a tremendous challenge of security. Most military formations were required to move forward, in order to secure the new borders, and few were available for rear-area activities. Police and second-line formations could help somewhat, but it was necessary to ensure they were not overwhelmed.\n\nA key element in ensuring this was in depriving any organization, overt, covert, or insurgent, from possessing both intelligent and highly placed leadership - politically or socially. Which meant that, despite the loss in efficiency across a wide range of civilian sectors that it would cause, those so educated who could not be considered politically reliable needed to be purged from their positions. They would be replaced with those whose reliability was certain.\n\nThat increase in reliability was likely to be accompanied by many problems in other areas, as many were considerably less skilled than those they were replacing. But the decision was necessary. Security was not something that anyone, in the military or administration besides, was willing to compromise on.\n\nAnd, so, in the early hours of the morning, orders were dispatched to soldiers and bureaucrats alike, depending on need. The day that followed promised to be eventful for them all."
PRC.95.a: "A necessary change."

PRC.96.t: "Rebuilding the Pacific Fleet"
PRC.96.desc: "It has been many, many years since members of our government have given anything but a passing thought to the matter of naval operations. However, with our increasing consolidation of control over the Far East's Pacific ports, this must change.\n\nThe oceans offer far too much promise, far too many opportunities for trade, and far too many potential avenues for attack upon our lands to ignore any longer. As such, it has been declared that the command structure for the Soviet Pacific Fleet be reactivated, in order to control all operations within the Pacific littoral and, in time, hopefully far beyond.\n\nWhile this does establish the necessary naval command infrastructure, a fleet of course needs ships, and so in addition to this proclamation, a program of focused and rapid ship design has additionally been announced. Though it will take time for the designs to be finalized, when they are we will be able to quickly construct ships optimized for our specific needs.\n\nIt may take years to reach anything approaching operational consideration by the powers of the world, but we will remain committed, and in time those same powers will learn to fear Soviet naval might."
PRC.96.a: "Once again, we will take to the seas."

PRC.97.t: "Naval Designs Completed!"
PRC.97.desc: "The first designs for ships, as ordered by the high command upon the instantiation of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, have been received in record time.\n\nIncorporating both modernized elements as well as customization for the particular operating environments of the Far East littoral and regional waters, the designs promise to provide the Pacific Fleet with the ability to effectively, at the very least, act to secure its waters. Furthermore, using these initial designs as inspiration and experience, those so assigned pledge to continue the program to deliver plans for ever more capable ships.\n\nWith the command structure established and the design plans drafted and finalized, the only thing that remains is to finally put the plan into action, and commence construction of the physical ships for later commissioning. Dockyard facilities in the east have been contacted and informed of the state's plans, and they have reported that they are ready and waiting to begin the process.\n\nWe need only give the word. When we believe the time to be right, and the resources to be available, we can begin shipbuilding at any moment desired."
PRC.97.a: "When should we begin?"

PRC.98.t: "Maintain Officer Elections?"
PRC.98.desc: "With the civilian administration firmly in control of the apparatus of state, we must turn our attention to the many issues that need resolving. One of the most important is that of the practice of electing military officers.\n\nLong an issue of contention among many groups within the government, military, and other spheres, the practice of electing officers within the armed forces is one of the earliest adopted by the Council in its initial form. It was believed, at the time, that such was the only way to ensure confidence in the command structure after the Union's fall.\n\nHowever, those times are long behind us, and many argue that to maintain the practice, given the expansion of the lands and formations within our state, expands the dangers of politicization to an unacceptable degree, in addition to limiting professionalism besides. This is countered by its supporters, who claim that the practice is essential to ensuring the cohesion of our formations.\n\nIt is clear that a choice will have to be made. All that remains to be seen is what the central civilian government will decide."
PRC.98.a: "The danger is unacceptable. End the elections."
PRC.98.b: "Elected officers led us to victory. Keep the elections."

PRC.99.t: "No Fighting in the War Room!"
PRC.99.desc: "Lieutenant Dmitriy slammed the door in the face of the complaining soldiers outside of the officer's mess. He wiped his brow, sweating despite the chill outside. "The men are even more rowdy today," he remarked to his fellow lieutenant, Kazimir. "Indeed," Kazimir responded, brushing a hand over his new coat.\n\n"It has to do with the elections," The first remarked with full certainty. "Indeed," said the second, leaning back in his chair. "The men are more upset than I thought they would be," Dmitriy added, taking a seat beside Kazimir now. He took up a hotcake on the table and chewed greedily.\n\n"Well, wouldn't you?" said Kazimir, now giving the other man his full attention. "The soldier elections allowed the men to choose whoever they wanted. We had to scramble to give them anything they wanted to keep some semblance of order. Even with total command being swapped over with whoever could promise them more privileges. It was madness. And it benefited them most of all."\n\n"And what should we do now? Ignore them completely?" Dmitriy asked Kazimir. The other man only grinned in response, then stood up and went to the door where the mob was still grumbling. Without fear Kazimir swung it open, causing the metal to slam against the barracks wall with a boom. "Oi!" He shouted, his fist banging on the wall three times. "Disperse the lot of you, or I'll write you up for insubordination! This is the officer's mess!"\n\nWith a few mumbling replies that went unheard by either lieutenant, the crowd broke apart without incident. Kazimir looked over to the first. "See? Now we can do whatever we want. So let's have some tea in peace without having to listen to their bitching all damn day."
PRC.99.a: "Rank has certain advantages, does it not?"

PRC.100.t: "Men are Lead by Leaders"
PRC.100.desc: "Gora was unable to sleep. The election was keeping him up. Not simply any election for the outcome of this would decide the fate of his division. Every day since the start, Gora had been working towards this post. In battle, he led his men to the best of his ability. The elections were crucial to this fragile, still reforming society. The officers may be bitter about how humiliating and embarrassing being forced to win votes from their subordinates. Gora saw it another way. It allowed the men with the ability and desire to lead. Rather than simply accumulating rank over time the truly competent flourished in this system.\n\nThough Gora might prefer the old system, at least now. As the votes were counted he was sleepless. His wife had long since gone to bed and the middle-aged veteran could only pace in their kitchen thinking of his concession or acceptance speeches. Which would he be giving in the morning? The other candidates were men he respected. It wasn't an issue with losing. But the indecisiveness of this state, this limbo, was clawing at his mind. How often had such scenes played out elsewhere in the army over these elections? The stress was almost as bad if not worse than that of battle. At least you know your enemy.\n\nThen, the door had a few knocks. Gora opened it in a sudden rush that seized him. A private stood on the doorstep smiling broadly at him. "Sir, you've won the command," He said, then stepped back outside leaving Gora speechless in the kitchen. Instantly the jubilation and fatigue settled into Gora, allowing him to sleep like a baby that night. So did the rest of the command, knowing that no matter what happened, the winner of the position was chosen by the soldiers."
PRC.100.a: "It's not the best system, but it's the best one we have."

PRC.101.t: "I Know a Guy"
PRC.101.desc: "It was the phrase that doomed him. A phrase that played out in his mind constantly. "I know a guy", Andropov said. Andropov promised it would be easy, that his candidate would be suited to the job. One ammo-depot explosion later and the whole system had fallen in. Now Yuri was stripped of his rank and facing a tribunal. The men were all veterans of the West Russian War, some including the Great Patriotic War. These were men with reputations beyond reproach. The trial was not simply for show, hundreds of soldiers and civilians were allowed to witness the proceedings.\n\nThat's why each piece of evidence put forward was as if Yuri had been stabbed. The papers kept unfurling from the hands of a battalion of secretaries and accountants. Each unveiled the dirty secrets of the army's corruption, in particular his own fetid corner of it. Yuri heard about the 'gross incompetent' of his particular choices for advancement. It had always been done to grease some wheels, or done with the promise of payment.\n\nAgain that blasted phrase repeated in his mind. "I know a guy", Andropov would say. "I know a guy who needs a favor." "I know a guy who has a need." Whatever Andropov promised, it would advance Yuri's career, his finances, and ultimately his comfort. Now the full extent of the damage that attitude caused had been let out. There was only one thing left to do. Fall on his sword. It would help bring a swift end to this suffering."
PRC.101.a: "Your honor, I would like to change my plea to guilty to all charges."
PRC.101.b: "Remove him immediately."

PRC.102.t: "Army? Corrupt? Say It Ain't So"
PRC.102.desc: "Yuri had worked for the past ten years in the People's Revolutionary Council. He hadn't served in the West Russian War, but had joined on shortly after the arrival of the Red Army in Tanna Tuva. He was one of the few ethnic Russians present and joined on for the promise of advancement. It all started with Andropov, his superior. He enlightened him to the way things were done in the army-government. A bribe here, a promotion there, just had to look the other way from time to time to prosper. Now, he was a colonel of his own regiment. Sure, had to make a few...compromises with his morals. But with army advancement came civilian advancement, thanks to the intertwined systems. Authority over his regiment came with authority over the local town. Which in turn meant that he had unparalleled command over the police and other sectors.\n\nThe Council proclaimed to be the successors of the ideals of Lenin and Bukharin. But Yuri knew better. His actions were that of a petty conqueror. Better yet when he appointed new commanders, it also meant that his control was further strengthened. It wasn't limited merely to Yuri. There were men far above him in rank playing this game of exchanged favors and promotions, all with a stranglehold over the civilian administration.\n\nIn the end did it truly matter? Did it change anything? Was him taking a bit off the top for him and his that bad? This was Russia, a land divided. It has known war for much of the long, bloody 20th century. He wasn't killing people, making them disappear. Simply, taking a bit of fat for him to chew. He wasn't a bad person. Besides, if he stopped, would that change anything? Some other easily swayed officer would take his place while he was passed on for promotion. And Yuri had more ambitions than his small corner. To do that, he would have to place a lot more men in power loyal to him first. That might put some incapable persons in charge but it shouldn't place anything too critical in their hands."
PRC.102.a: "What's the worst that could happen?"

PRC.103.t: "No Self-Proclaimed Villains"
PRC.103.desc: "For the past twenty years, Alexei Andropov had fought not for any man, god, or country. He fought only for himself. As the saying went, rich men have dreams and poor men die to make them true. Early in his life Andropov realized the only truth of life is what you take for yourself. He played the long game inside of the People's Revolutionary Council, in their early days. He stayed in the back. He made jokes. He bought people drinks when not much was to be gained. He never took sides and he never made enemies, only friends. Everyone loved Andropov. When it came time to win officers to his side, he was the unsuspecting devil on their shoulder. He whispered honey and gave freely. He was generous, not greedy - no he was positively delightful.\n\nBut the time had come to drop that mask. Because how unsuspecting he was, no one anticipated his revolt. His men had stormed the city garrison with ease. His orders were to shoot any soldier on the street and tell people to stay in doors. Nominally his revolt was because of the unfair treatment to the soldiers of the people. In reality, Andropov saw the writing on the wall. There wasn't going to be any more civilian postings for the army. His ascent was going to be checked. Now, a city burned, because he was damned if this was all his hardwork would earn him. Later he might justify this act with some quote from Caesar or something like that."

PRC_flavor.1.t: "Distant Days"
PRC_flavor.1.desc: "Sitting alone at a table for two in the barracks mess hall, Leonid Brezhnev looked ahead in contemplation. How long had it been, he thought, since he had had some time alone? Not since before the war, surely. The big one, the second 'war to end all wars.' Which, like the first, it hadn't.\n\n"Leonid!" A voice called to him, and Brezhnev turned and saw his friend Pavel Batitsky running up to him. "So sorry I'm late. Drilling the men took longer than I thought." Taking a seat, he looked Brezhnev in the eyes with concern. "You never ask to meet with me like this. What... did you wish to speak about?"\n\nA moment of silence passed between them. "Do you remember Ukraine, Pavel? The fields, the people, the grand cities?"\n\nBatitsky blinked in surprise. "Well yes, how could I forget? It is hard to forget your own home and neighbors."\n\nBrezhnev let out a sigh. "I suppose you're right. I just miss it so much, Pavel. The Germans took everything from us, and I live in fear that we won't get it back. More than anything, I want to go home, and I want that home to be free."\n\nWith a gentle smile, Batitsky reaches across the table and places a hand on Brezhnev's shoulder. "It will be one day, comrade. We'll make sure of that.""

PRC_flavor.2.desc: "Blinking in surprise, Issa Pliev could hardly believe what his eyes showed him. Of all the people he expected to run up to him out of breath, Leonid Brezhnev certainly wasn't one of them. "Is everything alright, comrade?" He asked the other man, worry showing on his face. "Is somebody hurt?"\n\n"Pliev!" Brezhnev exclaimed, not answering the questions. "Why didn't you tell me you were from the Caucasus?"\n\nThis only served to confuse Pliev further. "Well, you never asked. I am from Ossetia, to be precise. Why the sudden interest?"\n\nBrezhnev averted his eyes, seeming almost... ashamed. It was, Pliev thought, very unlike him. "I served in the Caucasus, during the war. The failures of that front... the fall of the Caucasus, of Ossetia, to the German boot was at least in part my fault. You have my sincerest apologies."\n\n"I see..." Pliev murmured, memories of the last time he had seen his homeland, his people, coming flooding back. He was not sad, though, or even angry. "Then, if you really want to apologize, when we fight the Germans once more, make sure you win. That's all I ask." He offered his hand to Brezhnev with a smile.\n\n"Wait, really?" Brezhnev was undeniably surprised, not having expected forgiveness. After staring for a moment at the outstretched hand, he took it and shook it with a small smile. "I see. Then you have my word. I'll give my all to throwing out the Germans the next time our forces face them, and liberate not only Moscow but all the Caucasus." With a wide grin, Pliev patted Brezhnev on the back."

PRC_flavor.3.t: "Echoes of Khalkhin Gol"
PRC_flavor.3.desc: "Two men on horseback slowed to a trot along the often porous eastern border, keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. "I don't see anything, Dandar." One of the men, Butochiyn Tsog, stated. The other man, Lodongiin Dandar, nodded but remained wary. "You know, Dandar, I don't think I understand why you decided to see the border for yourself, and brought me along with you. Wouldn't it have been better to leave this to the soldiers?"\n\nTurning to face Tsog, Dandar shook his head. "Part of being a leader of men is not ordering them to do anything you yourself wouldn't do, and I live by that principle. As for why I invited you out here..." He turned away, looking out into the horizon. "Do you remember Khalkhin Gol? All the bloodshed, the corpses, and finally the victory?" One that felt pretty hollow these days, but neither decided to bring that up.\n\n"Of course I remember, how could anyone there ever forget?" Tsog said bitterly. "If I'd known that the damn Japanese were going to destroy our homeland like this, I would've killed twice as many as the cowards ran away."\n\nYes, Tsog definitely had the right spirit for what was to come, Dandar thought. "I've been thinking, we not only should liberate the country, we should restore it to the power it held in those days, when the rising sun fled from the hammer and sickle." Suddenly, Dandar grinned mirthfully. "Though, we sure have our work cut out for us, huh?" They shared a laugh at the last part."

PRC_flavor.4.desc: "If he were a soldier, perhaps Jambyn Batmönkh would be more hardened to, more willing to tolerate, the realities of conflict. As it was, he could barely stop himself from weeping at what he saw. Here he was, in his cherished native Uvs province, yet this was not the one he remembered. He remembered it being a land of relative plenty, with a bright future and tough but happy people.\n\nNow there were people starving, amputees struggling to get by, and most of all, a seemingly universal feeling of hopelessness. Had the war really changed so much? If this was what it was like here, where there had been little direct conflict, he shuddered to think of what it must be like in areas the Japanese and their collaborators had actually occupied.\n\nEven with that said, however, he wondered if there was really no peaceful solution to the trouble Mongolia faced. Even if they had helped bring chaos to Mongolia, surely it was possible to talk things out with the other factions. They were all Mongols, after all, heirs of a great legacy and destined for a bright future. He just wished someone, anyone else would want a peaceful solution. As always, his thoughts went unvoiced, and unheard."

The number of people he had seen begging for food, for money, for anything while touring Aldarkhaan was unbelievable. His homeland was no longer recognizable to him, and it was all the fault of those damned Japanese.\n\nIt was the Japanese who had killed his people with the help of those traitorous collaborators, it was the Japanese who stole their resources for their own profit, and it was the Japanese who had torn his country apart, pitting brother against brother. One day, they'd get what was coming to them. His fellow Mongols deserved that much. For today, however, he would continue to observe, and let his rage build. When the time came he would destroy the invaders without a second thought. Revenge had to be exacted.\n\nEven if that revenge necessitated further suffering."
