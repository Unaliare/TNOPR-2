 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_MEN_DESC: "Alexander Vladimirovich Men never asked to be a shepherd to so many, to have his flock's lives entrusted in his care, or to feel the weight of Heaven upon his shoulders - and yet he is all of these things, the Father of the North.\n\nAnd yet this was not always so. A Jewish child baptized as an infant, Men's father was taken from him when he was six years old, dragged to the Gulags by the NKVD on false charges, leaving the young boy with a strong conviction against the fear and tyranny so many throughout the world felt. Despite the dangers of underground worship in the Union, Men remained a devout Christian, albeit a very unorthodox one. A firm believer in equality transcending class, sex, race, and even faith, Men's ideas were almost an unknown within the Church, or even the Union as a whole.\n\nIn the dark times following the death of the Union, Men found himself in the frozen north, comforting the struggling peasantry, offering them God's love - and his own words if they did not accept the Lord's. He told them of his hopes for a land of truly freed men and women, a land of egalitarianism, a place of communes and villages where all would be unchained.\n\nHis beliefs and actions began to gather support among the isolated communities of Siberia. Slowly at first, then all at once, the isolated villages of the north pledged their belief in their Father.\n\nToday the North marches against the chaos that has inflamed the Holy Motherland for so long, and with their Father's watchful gaze, they will bring deliverance and salvation to all who suffer."

 POLITICS_GURZHAP_OCHIROV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "For as long as he can remember, Gurzhap Vanyushkeevich Ochirov has lead a life on the wrong side of the law. In his early life, he was a mere bandit, preying on traders who ventured far away from civilization as they knew it. Then, his fortunes had transformed after a desperate Yagoda recruited him to lead a band of Buryat men to garrison the out-of-the-way village of Aldan. When the Bolsheviks regained control of the settlement, Ochirov found himself recruited by a wayward soldier named Sudoplatov. While his superior dreamed of forging a united Russia under the banner of Father Men, Ochirov held no true loyalty but to his homeland - Buryata.\n\nNow that his commanding officer has betrayed the Father, Ochirov has emerged from the shadows, returning to the town of Aldan and gathering a band of patriots for the liberation of Buryata. His opponent, Gomboev, claims to be building a new future for the Buryat following Men's example, but Ochirov sees through his lies. He knows that the Christians could never be a true friend to his people. He will no longer tolerate any foreign occupiers or pathetic collaborationists. Ochirov will secure a future for the Buryats, or he will die trying."
 
 POLITICS_LEONID_CHERNYKH_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Leonid Nikolayevich Chernykh's expedition marks the second time White Army forces have crossed the Amur into the wild, untamed lands of post-Soviet Russia. Chernykh's aims, however, stand in stark contrast to those of his comrades-in-arms in decades prior. In contravention to the few principles that the White Army once held close to its chest, Chernykh has submitted to the authority of a Communist: Pavel Sudoplatov.\n\nThe near-destruction of the White Army and their return to exile was a sobering experience, and Chernykh debated on whether or not the White movement in Harbin even had any grounds to continue existence. The collapse of Alexander Men's so-called Divine Mandate would cause a radical shift in the White remnants' thinking, and Chernykh was suddenly being begged by his remaining officers to march north once again.\n\nUpon his return to the Far East, however, it became clear to Chernykh that his forces were in no position to undertake any serious military operations. He was quick to send a message to Sudoplatov and the NKVD, offering his forces' help in stabilizing the region in exchange for food and supplies. Leonid Chernykh is a man with few hills left to die on. He cares no longer for the restoration of the Tsar, nor the dream of a White Russia. Chernykh only looks to shield his people from the uncertainty of anarchy."
 
 POLITICS_ZHAMBAL_GOMBOEV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Zhambal-Dorzhi Gomboev, Soviet loyalist, Buddhist, and war veteran, had never thought that he would one day follow the banner of a man of Christ. He had begun his career as a mere lackey of the NKVD, appointed by Yagoda as a token representative of the Buddhist population of the Far East. When many of his Buryat countrymen had joined the ranks of Sablin's mad rebellion, Gomboev had remained by Yagoda's side - perhaps out of a sense of loyalty.\n\nWhen word came of a Christian peasant uprising to the north, Gomboev rallied his co-religionists against the Father, for his people had a long memory of how the Christians had treated them. But when the Father cast down the Bolshevik remnants, Gomboev had been approached not with hatred, but with mercy. Father Men, out of a desire to accommodate those of all faiths, renewed Gomboev's position as the chief representative of Buddhism in Russia.\n\nAfter the Father had been betrayed, Gomboev had cleverly played Yakunin and Sudoplatov off, diverting their attention from his attempt to build a Buddhist socialist nation for the Buryat people, only to be evicted from his home by the partisan Ochirov. Now, he and his project fight for their very survival against a man who is unlikely to show willingness to compromise."
 
 POLITICS_NIKOLAY_IVANOVSKY_COLLAPSE_DESC: "The Pacific Fleet was never the most important arm of the Red Navy, but it had been a glorious and fearsome armada compared to the vestigial fleet of rusted hulks that now sit derelict in the harbors of Kamchatka. Nikolay Stepanovich Ivanovsky is the admiral of this ghostly flotilla, sending out the few seaworthy vessels he still commands to search for plunder in the frozen waters of the Arctic.\n\nAs the Divine Mandate disintegrated, a desperate Pavel Sudoplatov was keen to find any allies he could get his hands on. Sensing a potential friend in Ivanovsky's local pirate group, Sudoplatov aided his return to power in Kamchatka in exchange for mutual protection. However, Sudoplatov did not realize that Ivanovsky was distrusted even amongst his comrades in the former Pacific Fleet regime. A prior demotion for "gross violation of military discipline" served as proof of their lack of faith.\n\nTrue to his nature, Ivanovsky did not even wait a second to stab his partner in the back, denying any knowledge of an alliance and declaring Sudoplatov's forces to be fair game. The admiral has no illusions of a return to normalcy. To Ivanovsky, Communism is a fools' errand compared to survival, and to survive, the Pacific Fleet must seize whatever they find, from whoever they encounter."
 
 POLITICS_PAVEL_SUDOPLATOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Pavel Anatolyevich Sudoplatov was once a follower of Father Men, or at least he claimed to be. He in fact drew near to the Father and to God with his lips while his heart was far away from them. Seeing without perceiving and hearing without understanding, he deluded himself into thinking that his leader was a mere naïve idealist who needed to be kept in check and acted accordingly.\n\nBy the Mother of God, how wrong he was.\n\nNow Sudoplatov is denounced as a new Judas, as a betrayer of the late Father's vision. Though he attempts to rebuild, the foundation is built on sand and collapses more and more day after day. Though Sudoplatov cries out to God, "turn not Thy face away from me, and withdraw not from Thy servant in Thy anger," it matters not; from Heaven as from Earth no help is forthcoming. All the universe has turned away.\n\nEven his so-called followers, those who were with him in the NKVD and so on, no longer trust him. They exploit his meager power for their own ends. But Pavel Sudoplatov no longer rejects any of this. All hope is dead within him. He will not unify Russia. No, he will die one day or another, and be remembered as what he was: a treasonous assassin who destroyed a movement forever.\n\nSudoplatov, prostrating in guilt at the grave of the holy man he betrayed, could not agree more."
 
 POLITICS_IVAN_NIKISHOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Ivan Fedorovich Nikishov, director of the Kolyma Developmental Zone, is in over his head.\n\nWay back in the when, Nikishov was a leader of General Directorate of Construction in the Far North. When the Directorate fell flat, replaced by the Divine Mandate, Nikishov was assigned to the north by Sudoplatov in order to develop the historically impoverished region. Nikishov, unimpressed by Sudoplatov, had only one plan: to plunder it as he had the first time around.\n\nBut Nikishov had only ever known the region as docile and dependent. Now, they hoard guns and stage raids, snapping the thin threads that hold Nikishov's illegitimate rule in place with little to no effort or casualties. The despair brought about by Sudoplatov's foolhardy treatment of the Father has not dampened their Christian zeal against "oppressors" such as Nikishov.\n\nNikishov dares not say it aloud, but he knows the reality of his situation all too well. Though the Fraternal Union of Father Alexander Men is no more, destroyed by a too-clever-by-half imbecile of a spy chief, its effect - that of inciting the people of the Far East to hope for a better reality - has not faded, and will have to be reckoned with for the foreseeable future. Its most immediate consequence may well be the fall of Nikishov's government."
 
 POLITICS_GLEB_YAKUNIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Father Gleb Pavlovich Yakunin is no stranger to fleeing for his life. In youth, his entire family had been relocated from Moscow to Irktursk ahead of the advancing German forces. When Yagoda seized absolute control of the Presidium, Father Yakunin vanished into the woods with his mentor, Father Men, to escape a cruel fate at the hands of the NKVD. He found temporary shelter in the true believers of the far north, but Father Men's divine mission would once again drive him forward.\n\nNow, Father Yakunin has made what he hopes will be his last journey. He does not know how he alone managed to evade Sudoplatov's thugs - only God could have saved him. He finds himself in Magadan, surrounded by the last remnants of Men's vision. He leads a flock of his own, preaching that hope still remains for the believers.\n\nBut these words ring hollow, for Father Yakunin is not the visionary and reformer that Men was. His interpretation of the Orthodox Faith is far more like the Tsarist Church - whose sins brought the wrath of God upon her. No matter his skill at oratory, Father Yakunin will never unite the Motherland. To the world, he is nothing but a sad reminder of the movement that could have redeemed the soul of Russia."
 
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_KUROEDOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Vladimir Alekseevich Kuroedov was selected by Sudoplatov to lead his 1st Army in the aftermath of the collapse of the Divine Mandate. It was Sudoplatov's desperate hope that Kuroedov's personal experience in religious administration would help him mollify the locals and win them over to his side.\n\nInstead, the old commander has been acting increasingly strange. Rather than acting like a general or a Holy Synod bureaucrat or anything else one might have expected, he has taken up a new public persona - that of a scheming, zealous preacher quoting from Scripture and the Apostolic Fathers and draping himself in the ways of the old Father. While few take this garish display at face value, its intent is obvious.\n\nAs order in the Far East becomes an ever more distant memory, and Kureodov increasingly refuses to follow reports from Amur, it is clear to all that the Protection Committee's likeliest challenger already lies within its walls."

 OMO_sermon_of_the_father: "Sermon of the Father"
 OMO_sermon_of_the_father_desc: ""For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm."\n\nEver since the Father began his sacred calling, guiding the lost souls of Siberia to the true way and showing them the path to salvation, he has attracted many followers. His own path has taken him many miles, but today, Alexander Men has given one last teaching to his faithful on the banks of the Omolon River, calling them to action against the forces of darkness that dominate the Far East and Russia as a whole. Already, we have begun to organize our faithful into bands and armies, preparing, once and for all, to establish a divine mandate."

 OMO_the_light_shines_in_darkness: "The Light Shines in Darkness"
 OMO_the_light_shines_in_darkness_desc: "The disappointing truth is that we are currently witnessing the darkest of times in the history of our people, as dark as those before the Light of the Message began to be spread among the Rus'. But we are the light that shines in the darkness. As such, we must stand above all the disgusting and sinful: statesmen and soldiers, rapists and pillagers, communists and fascists, to show the people our virtue. For the Father has taught us that to live a life in reflection of Christ is the best way to inspire those under the influence of darkness to find salvation. And if there are those who will not accept our image and example, casting it down and threatening our message, the might of God will be cast upon them and they will be smote down.\n\n"And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.""

 OMO_burn_the_idols: "Burn the Idols"
 OMO_burn_the_idols_desc: "As the Father taught from Colossians, "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry."\n\nThe vile nature of the state institutions that promoted, spread, and sublimated the people to mammon, the evil influence of wealth, has corrupted them and caused rampant greed, a ruinous trend. We must take action to eliminate these institutions that have kept our otherwise faithful people obedient to money and wealth. For no Christian should worship money and power before God. Of course, these institutions will not go quietly into the night, so to speak, and to eliminate them completely, freeing our people from the burden of their influence, will take some time."

 OMO_the_communal_union: "The Communal Union"
 OMO_the_communal_union_desc: "Once we have finished pulling down the pillars of the old institutions, just as Jesus overthrew the merchant's tables in the temple, we must reforge our society around the true tenets of Christianity in the eyes of God and his son. Taking on lessons found both in the Bible and in the teachings of the Father, we will establish a new system of interconnectedness and cooperation between our communities based on the tenets of communal property, fair distribution of labor, abolition of currency, and freedom from landlords and governmental authorities.\n\nIt is imperative that we create this communal union, not just to ensure that our people will live as Christ had intended us to, but also to forge a strong, Christian mandate, first in Siberia, and then throughout Russia. Only once this system is in place will we be confident in our ability to save the Russian people from the darkness."

 OMO_denounce_the_oath: "Denounce the Oath"
 OMO_denounce_the_oath_desc: ""Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.' But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one."\n\nNo man should be bound by an earthy oath - these oaths are rooted in the evil one and are inherently sinful. Thus, we should denounce our oaths to the mortal man and his institutions and encourage all others to do so - these oaths and those who force them upon the people help despots and sinful warlords to masquerade as mediators between God and man."

 OMO_all_one_in_christ: "All One in Christ"
 OMO_all_one_in_christ_desc: "Father Men is no normal priest. He teaches radical ideas, some might even call ideals, that break with almost every other interpretation of the faith. That being said, it is precisely these radical ideas that have garnered such a following. One of his most radical - and powerful - teachings is that for God, there is no Gentile, and there is no Jew. Every servant of God is equal before His eyes, no matter their nation nor creed. As the Father once proclaimed, "There is no divide between brothers and sisters within our rank!"\n\nTruly, the despotists and bandits have crushed the people under their boots, and have allowed darkness to infiltrate the lives of every community that they control. These radical ideas, vehemently rejected by these despots and atheists, will help us attract a following even among the most oppressed of their populations."

 OMO_yet_the_darkness_did_not_overcome: "Yet the Darkness Did Not Overcome"
 OMO_yet_the_darkness_did_not_overcome_desc: "The first statement God ever uttered was "Let there be light" - the first thing that he created was light and its associated lightness. This lightness exists in all of humanity, no matter how dark the world around us may seem. It is taught by both the Bible and the Father that God loves his children and will redeem our world. No matter what will happen, no matter the hardships experienced, and no matter the dangers that lie ahead, we are God's tools to ensure that regardless of the events in the coming months, God will ensure that the darkness will not now, nor ever, overcome the light.\n\n"Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life'.""

 OMO_arm_the_believers: "Arm the Believers"
 OMO_arm_the_believers_desc: "If we are realistic, living by example and preaching in the frozen wastes of Northern Siberia will only get our movement so far. Indeed, it seems like it has already begun to paint a target on our backs by some of the more paranoid despots and their lackeys. Thus, we need to begin to prepare for a great confrontation with the armies of darkness. It has become obvious that we will approach this two-fold: the first is by preparing Sudoplatov and his troops, and the second is by beginning to mobilize our Christian militias and arming them in any way possible. Sudoplatov, while somewhat of a wild card, has been useful to us so far. It is time that we put our faith in him and his soldiers - they will be an integral part in our upcoming struggles. And our militias, filled with the most vehement of our followers, will flow over the forces of darkness like a second flood - but this time, instead of water punishing the wicked, it will be our brave soldiers, fighting for the sake of the light."

 OMO_sudoplatovs_brigade: "Sudoplatov's Brigade"
 OMO_sudoplatovs_brigade_desc: "It's no secret that Pavel Sudoplatov is an odd and eccentric character - his career has previously been defined by everything that we preach against, including his cooperation with and employment by the terror of Irkutsk, Genrikh Yagoda. That being said, it's also clear the benefit that Sudoplatov has brought with him - not only his military know-how and experience in the south, but a whole brigade of soldiers, loyal to his beck and call. On top of this, he has also achieved the fame and status of a folk hero, who has been continuously fighting against injustice after his defection, a man seeking redemption for his past acts. For now, Sudoplatov seems to be a willing ally of ours, and his brigade - a group of professional, NKVD-trained troops, are ultimately an invaluable asset for us going forwards."

 OMO_infiltrate_their_castles: "Infiltrate Their Castles"
 OMO_infiltrate_their_castles_desc: "Sudoplatov and his loyalists are all quite familiar with the asymmetrical warfare which will be invaluable to our cause in the coming years. Indeed, our message of a popular, Christian movement against the despots of the Far East will be highly popular among some of the most impoverished and poor peasants in their villages. Thus, we should arm Sudoplatov's agents with their experience and our message in order to infiltrate our enemy's frontlines and disrupt their stability via the instigation of peasant revolts. This will not only cause destabilization but surely their retaliation, which, typical of agents of darkness will only serve to win over more people to our beliefs.\n\n"To the sound of musicians at the watering places, there they repeat the triumphs of the Lord, the triumphs of his peasantry in Israel. Then down to the gates marched the people of the Lord.""

 OMO_fraternal_militias: "Fraternal Militias"
 OMO_fraternal_militias_desc: "Sudoplatov's brigade, while already having proved its usefulness many times over, will not be enough to extend our authority and liberate our people from the darkness. As such, we need to begin organizing our believers into coherent armed forces, peasant armies, so to speak, under the banner of God and the liberation of our brothers. These "fraternal militias" will be the backbone of our liberation forces, and will be trained to the best of our abilities both for asymmetrical and conventional forms of warfare, to ensure that they are best equipped for the upcoming conflict. After all, many of the volunteers who have already come forward, have never even fired a rifle at another human before.\n\n"It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.""

 OMO_take_the_towns: "Take the Towns"
 OMO_take_the_towns_desc: "Many of the towns that are ostensibly under our control and filled with our followers are still, in reality, clinging to the old tenets of anarchy and arbitrariness. Bandits, moneylenders, and sinners reign supreme in these cities, and despite our best efforts to remove these agents of darkness from power, we've been unable to. At this point, in order to secure our control over the towns in our territory, we must mobilize the peasants in order to drive the darkness out of the towns and restore the light within the people there, integrating them into our communal union. Many have pointed out that this would indeed be a good initial exercise for the newly-formed Fraternal Militias, who are still ironing out some of the more glaring issues."

 OMO_end_the_thieves: "End the Thieves"
 OMO_end_the_thieves_desc: "When the Union collapsed, the Soviet Far Eastern Fleet fled from Vladivostok, fearing the oncoming Japanese, and ended up relocating to the Kamchatka Peninsula. While this patriotic move was widely regarded as popular, since then, the Far Eastern Fleet, realizing the harsh conditions of Kamchatka have resorted to piracy and thievery to scratch out a living on the frozen peninsula. Their piracy is indiscriminate, and they target both the poor and the rich, Russian and non-Russian. Clearly, these former patriots have lost sight of the true way, and have embraced the darkness. It is time that we once again mobilize our fraternal militias and expel the pirates from the Kamchatka, by force if necessary, in order to integrate it into our ever-growing mandate and save those under their control!"

 OMO_rouse_the_masses: "Rouse the Masses"
 OMO_rouse_the_masses_desc: "With the pirates dealt with, we can finally focus on bringing down the despots, oppressors, and bandits down. These are the men in the grips of darkness, so deeply so that they are unable to see the light, and will never understand our mission and our goal. We can live by example, quote from the Holy Texts, and show the benefits of the Communal Union, but these men are too far gone to be confronted with the truth and accept it. Thus, it's clear that further action must be taken to ensure that the people under their autocratic rule are freed from their chains and allowed to see the message. Father Men has already scheduled a public sermon that is to be broadcasted to all those to hear, about the importance of tenacity and spiritual purity, rousing the masses and preparing all for the beginning of the struggle against the oppressors."

 OMO_bring_the_sword: "Bring the Sword"
 OMO_bring_the_sword_desc: ""The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound."\n\nIf anything has become clear in the past few months, between the formation of the Communal Union and the fraternal militias, the beginning of the peasant revolts and our taking of the towns, it is that the people have heard the call of our Lord God and his ever-faithful servant, Father Men. It is time to liberate our brothers and sisters in Christ from the tyranny of the Bolshevik pretenders and their reactionary, fascistic counterparts. The struggle will not be an easy one but it is a necessary one. For it is the call of our followers to bring light back to our broken nation, and reintroduce hope and truth to a land gripped by darkness."

 OMO_the_harbinger_of_deceit: "The Harbinger of Deceit"
 OMO_the_harbinger_of_deceit_desc: ""You live in the midst of treachery; by deceit they shall deny knowing Me." Jeremiah 9:6.\n\nIt is written: their words shall be obedient but their hearts will be far away. So has it been for those that claim to rule the Far East - the yoke of those peoples that once followed God has grown heavy under the rule of the godless, those who would spin fables of a golden future of freedom even as the present shook under their iron-tipped boots. But the people of the Lamb will not be shaken by their lies.\n\nAlready our brethren in the Godless Places, the Red-Banner Lands, spread the Word, desperate, ceaseless in their efforts. They whisper of broken promises and the whips whose cracks echo behind the marching armies. They hint at the sorrow that belies all trust in the world and its "protectors", its Marshals and Premiers - and at a better one in the making. One where the Prince of Peace has made a true, lasting, just home for all Russians.\n\nAnd, they say, the time is coming when that home will be ripe for the taking."

There have always been the faithful, the servants - and there have always been those who would seek to lord over and destroy them. And so it goes on and on, without end until the King of Heaven returns.\n\nThe latest to take up this mantle claims continuity from the blood-spattered Union that came before it - and like that old tyranny fell apart in turn, once its sins broke their fetters and overwhelmed the men who ruled over it. Their kingdom without a king worships Yagoda, and behind him the blood-red gun-barrel, as the arbiter of truth. Power and power alone their watchword, they broke the backs of the villages they conquered, without even the pretence of serving the people they claimed to represent.\n\nNothing is new under the sun. With every Pharaoh that comes, a Moses rises from the bulrushes - and the Red Sea stirs once more. We shall declare unto the blood-red waters that the Lord has come to save his people - and to strike down the chains that bind them, with the Oppressor close behind."

Amos 5:21\n\nEven before the Tsar fell to Bolshevik gunfire and the Bolsheviks, in turn, to German fury, the Church that sustained Russia had fallen far. Masses and priests to deliver them were many, and yet few believed in earnest. The Father has seen this, and has determined that the new Jerusalem he is building shall not be the Israel of the Kings, doomed to disobedience and dissolution. His shall be the Kingdom of God alone - and the coronation draws ever nearer.\n\nLiturgies shall be made understandable in vernacular speech to the people, and their purpose explained to hungry souls. The Bible, so long the sole province of priests and their Old Church Slavonic, will be translated and distributed to the masses desperate for a dream. And the Wandering Priests that once spread the Gospel across Russia shall be reborn, a final generation of prophets for an age of fresh wonders.\n\nAs the Church rebuilds itself, its walls shining like the sun, the Lord Himself shall dwell among them - and victory, now as ever, belongs to those who bear the Cross."

Leviticus 25:10\n\nIt has always been the task of the Lord's chosen to deliver the Good News to the enslaved. Just as it was under the yoke of the Romans, the Spirit dwells closest to those whose hearts long for freedom, and it is in these hearts that the seeds of true faith are most fertile. And now that despots reign unfettered across the Rodina, the time has come to promise the lost exactly what they want to hear - freedom, not in a hundred years or a dozen, but now.\n\nThe Priests we have sent across the lands of the Far East deliver pamphlets by the thousand, speaking household by household of a freedom unlike any other - freedom from the yokes of Red and Black, freedom from the petty Tsars and their worthless courts, freedom to live and love and worship. The lights shine in the darkness - and the darkness shall not overcome them.\n\nFor, they say, a final battle approaches - and this time the seas shall not close over armies alone, but sweep away the whole of broken Russia.

Peace, land, bread and liberty - we have heard this promise before, and we have seen only the shattered parishes and razed churches stretching to the horizon in its wake. If this Sablin fellow truly meant to leave the Russian people in peace, he need only have given up the banner of the Sword and Sickle - and yet it is that, and not the Banner of the Cross Arrayed, that waves over the Baikal Lake.\n\nGod has no patience for sorcerers.

Once there was a golden statue, a beacon of worship and of faith in the power of a single man. Once there was desolation wrought upon the God-fearing, and a choice. Worship a man or die the death of a beast.\n\nWhen it came Russia's time to behold its own terrible King, nearly all bowed, in unvoiced fear or in genuine adoration. The Kingdom he and his successors reigned over fell quickly, a house on shifting sands. And yet the broken pedestal remains, a platform for all manner of vermin to feed upon the hopes of the Motherland. His name is still whispered even in the lands burnt over by our Priesthood, a name to terrify and to awe: Lenin. Lenin. Lenin.\n\nChrist alone stands as the Judge of Men.

Priests have become important intercessories between our central administration and the villages they manage - truly a bridge between the coming Kingdom and the realm of men - but their abilities are limited by their sheer lack of numbers as well as external pressures.\n\nTo create a better world, sacrifices must be made. We will create agencies to manage the finances and the laws in the Far East, and ensure that these positions are filled solely with those we deem virtuous. There is no room for the complainer, the doubter and the closet secularist in our New Jerusalem, and certainly not in its highest offices.\n\nAs for those who deem it corruption, or accuse us of marrying power to the Church: their courage is well-placed, even if their faith is not.

Why make enemies of those we could use to spread the Good News?\n\nAnd as we pray with them, we will keep one eye open, and one ear to the ground - the kingdom we are building here is vast as our Lord is kind, but it has no room for those who would turn traitor again."

So great was His regret that He purged Earth of its creatures with forty days and nights of rain. None were spared from Judgement excepting a man of faith and his family, forewarned into building a great ark. When the waters subsided and the dove returned with an olive leaf, he and his descended the mountains of Ararat to people the cleansed world anew.\n\nFrom the heights of Yakutsk did Father Men too behold the Kingdom he had built, and he sees the destruction evinced by decades of miserable war.

God's sacred Words were left to ring fruitless and hollow as the faithful debase themselves with vice, impiety, and mortal sin. At its terminus is a civilization so advanced in its rot as to taint even groundwater beneath bedrock, to divorce they who dwell above from the Lord, render their spirits fully deaf.\n\nUnto these personages did our vengeful God levy His terrible, swift vengeance.

Plying a trade involving His creations, so wont to plenty one season and meagerness the next, oft instills an appreciation for the firm hand He plays over our lives. And from there blossoms forth faith as unshakable as stone.\n\nThat He had chosen the Distant East for the Father's ordained undertakings speaks much of His awe-inspiring prescience; here squalorous cities are sparse, while farmland, pasture and rivers are splayed across its expanse like grass on verdant rolling hills.

Father Men sees differently.\n\nThrough contemplation and careful reading, he has evinced the truth: the Lord created no simple helper for Adam, else He would have ignored all pretense and created the perfect beast. No, He instead created a companion with whom to experience His creations. Each has different roles set about by their physiques, yet they are no less each other's equal than the Lord God is their father.\n\nHow far we have fallen from the Garden if all the world's peoples subverted His earliest teachings so. But now is always a good time to begin our travels to redemption's rocky paths."

Patience ranks at the forefront of these tenets; after all, divergences in thought and practice among Earth's manyfold peoples are inevitabilities, like sunrise and sunset. To castigate the different-minded for their very being is akin to accusing a faithful man of heresy for sustaining themselves with loaves of bread rather than the Word of God alone.\n\nIt is with this guided spirit that the Father, in his capacity as God's ordained intercessor, decrees the protection of all faiths under His ever-present watch: the Jews, the Muslims, the pagans, and the thousand others that had sprung forth after Creation.

Far better that the flock welcome back wayward sheep like family, though their wool has grown coarse and their bellows foreign.\n\nOur Lord has chosen to believe in these unbelievers; Father Men too shall believe in them. For the impious, the impenitent, the freethinker - those who chose to cast away their faith for reasons only they can explain before God - theirs, as with the faithful, is the Kingdom of Heaven.

By God's will, we shall grant additional autonomy to the villages until they are able to function as autonomous organs.

A former adherent of Yagoda and the NKVD's teachings, he left them to follow the word of the Father. Despite leaving his old masters behind him, Sudoplatov still practices their methods, and this troubles the Father. There is no denying that his men are effective on the battlefield and he has many connections to those who may help our cause, but Father Men sees his conduct as barbarous and unchristian. By working closely with Sudoplatov we might be able to bring the Father's word to all of Russia, but we must be careful that we do not lose sight of our values if we do. Just as Jesus faced temptation during his 40 days in the desert, Father Men must now face the temptations of power placed before him."

Though the NKVD was a cruel atheistic organization that abused the people of Russia, its members had an advanced understanding of warfare and managing a modern army. These men already proved their devotion to our cause during the struggle to unite eastern Siberia. Sudoplatov has offered to further integrate them into our forces, using the NKVD as the basis for a new army. The Father must decide if the strength they would bring is worth welcoming barbarous wolves into his flock, or if he will stay true to the word of God, even if it means risking everything he and his followers have built."

Sudoplatov's soldiers killed unnecessarily and terrorized civilians during the reclamation of the south, and until they repent they will not be welcome in our armies. God commands that Thou shalt not kill, and while there are exceptions for warfare there is never an excuse for unnecessary murder. Our army shall be righteous and humane in its conduct, even if that places us at a disadvantage against our foes. Any who shall not abide by our laws will not fight under our flag.

Perhaps the Lord sent them to us so that we may redeem these men by working with them? After all, the cause they fight for is righteous, even if they themselves are not. By reminding them of the teachings of God and the Father, we may be able to persuade them to act in a more Christian manner towards their foes. Even if they disregard Father men's words, his mission is too important to risk failure by casting away his allies. If only those allies were more respectful of God's laws."

There was little central authority, and the Father counted on the faithful to do their part and keep the peace. Now that eastern Siberia has been unified, Sudoplatov has begun calling for Father Men to increase his control. The Father agrees that a formal police force to maintain public order is necessary, but Sudoplatov wishes to go several steps further. He has asked that his men be authorized to enforce discipline in the villages and communes of the Mandate. This would be a step back towards the tyranny of the NKVD, but it may be a necessary step. There are many trials to come and a strong, centralized state may be necessary to overcome them."

His vision is clouded by his years in the NKVD, an organization that fostered a cult of paranoia and authoritarianism. In the Mandate there will be no secret police and midnight knocks at the door. God is the only one fit to judge his children, and we shall leave the matter of judgement for Him in his infinite wisdom. We shall maintain good order and Christian ethics throughout our nation, but we do not need the authoritarian methods Sudoplatov has called for to do this. Local police and security forces will be more than enough to keep the peace and make sure that God's commandments are heeded by his people."

 OMO_discipline_creates_holiness_desc: "Perhaps Sudoplatov has a good point. God has an order to his creations, and while we do not have the wisdom to grasp the plans of the Almighty, surely he did not mean for his children to live in disorganization and anarchy. Our territory has grown rapidly and it is already massive. Controlling this much land will require a strong and purposeful hand. Sudoplatov's new security force will make sure that the laws of the nation are rigorously followed. After all, every flock needs its shepherds to guide the wayward sheep back to the pasture. We must hope Sudoplatov's shepherds will show more mercy and restraint now than they did when they served Yagoda and the Soviet Union."

 OMO_sudoplatovs_connections_desc: "In his time working for Yagoda, Sudoplatov worked with many talented individuals. These talents were specifically focused on what is politely called asymmetric warfare. Subterfuge, sabotage, assassination, ect. Father Men finds these people morally reprehensible. They hide themselves in shadows and strike without mercy, denying their foes a chance to surrender and repent and not caring how many innocents they hurt or kill as long as they accomplish their goal. Their methods are unchristian but there's no denying how effective they are. Sudoplatov has offered to use their talents against our enemies. Fighting in such a dishonorable way is contrary to everything the Father teaches, but if we are to unite Russia as Christ has commanded such tactics may be necessary."

 OMO_one_does_not_live_by_power_alone_desc: "Father Men did not create the Divine Mandate as a path to power. He founded it on the orders of God Almighty to pull the Russian people out of darkness and back into His light. God is guiding our path, and as long as we do not stray from his teachings he shall not steer us wrong. We do not need to resort to trickery and espionage as our opponents do. We shall meet them, as friends or as enemies, honorably and righteously, knowing that we stand with the Lord and he will not fail us. Whether he succeeds or fails in his task Father Men will go forward with a clean consciousness knowing he has conducted himself as any good Christian should. Sudoplatov's offer is alluring, but the temptation of power is the oldest temptation of all, and the Father will not be led astray."

 OMO_and_yet_so_many_could_be_saved_desc: "Nothing is more important than the lives of God's creations, not even our principles. Sudoplatov's methods are dishonorable, even cowardly, but they might make the difference between a quick conflict and a drawn-out struggle. If a few unchristian acts could save thousands of Christian lives and prevent untold suffering, would it not also be unchristian not to act and condemn so many good children of the Lord to perish? Father Men is uncomfortable with the decision but he must care for his followers above all else. He can only hope that God will understand that he is just a man, as imperfect as any other. Perhaps in the end it will all have been worth it. The Father prays it will be."
 
 OMO_await_judgement: "Await Judgement"
 OMO_await_judgement_desc: "For many months now Sudoplatov has sent various requests and demands to Father Men, seeking to reform the Divine Mandate to fit his vision and entrench his influence. His suggestions have been logical, well reasoned, and effective, but they clash with the Father's morals and the teachings of God Almighty. After months of intensifying conflict between the two, Sudoplatov's demands have finally stopped coming in. It appears a new equilibrium has been reached. Either Sudoplatov has finally accepted Men's teachings and realized the error of his old ways, or the Father has succumbed to enough of his temptations that he is ready to escalate his campaign to reform Siberia to the next level. Only the Lord knows which shall come to pass. For the people of Russia, time shall have to tell."

 OMO.10.d: "The Grace of the Almighty comes not through the palms of mankind, nor the rituals and incantations of the pagan; rather, the LORD shines through the passions of mankind, through the goodness of the heart and justness of the soul, as the miracles of the LORD bless mankind through the waking days of life.\n\nOn the great mount did the light of the Father, the vessel of the one, true God, shine through. Thereso did the Father lead us all in prayer, singing the hymns to bless this land, hoping one day for a home of homes, inheriting the meek and lowly to find new life above all. There did the winter winds scar the walls, yet the fires of faith protected all who stood in prayer, blanketed neath the holy words of the Father, as he brought our souls closer to the heavens than any other in Russia could know. Here was where there were songs and prayers and cries, where the men and women of these far-off lands came together under the watchful eyes of our Father. And here was where the light of the LORD has been brought, and the flame of missionarian life was birthed into the world.\n\nAs the great and powerful Father watched on, it was his dear followers who brought forth the notion of spreading the faith across these frozen lands. It was by the Father's will, by God's will, as our great Father rests, we shall burn the way for the LORD in Russia!"
 OMO.10.a: "Blessed be the Russian Snow."
 
 OMO.11.t: "The Sins of Our Roots"
 OMO.11.d: "Sin cometh not of the font of darkness, shadow, and abomination in the world any longer; rather, sin works in disguise, beguiling mankind through attraction and lust to bring them more closely to the realm of Gehenna. Yes, the very Valley of Hinnom fills this Earth with the moneylender, the bandit, and the embezzler, as the Father so greatly marches into the depths of one such pit of Sin.\n\nSon and Father, Brother and Brother, the Fraternal Militia of our faith followed the Father into such a place that day. Weary from their travels, yet nevermore wishing for the corruption of decadence to strike the heart of our Home again. Thus what needed to be done was ordered forth by our Father: the moneylender's banks were forced closed, shutting out the serpent of Sin. The bandit was arrested that day, to be tried on order of violations of the Holy Scripture. And the embezzler, how greatly did he plead as he was brought away from his wretched place of sloth and greed. However, as the crackling of gunfire began, so greatly did the Fratern return hostilities, sending our Father into a fit of remorse as our soldiers so greatly went forth, bringing the burning judgement of the LORD down!\n\nAnd thus, in accordance with the will of the LORD, so too did the village burn that day, so that holy fires may cleanse this land from putridity and sin. However, as the soldiers, the judges of Mankind under one holy God, cried out in praise and victory, so greatly did our Father fall to his knees, as the night sky adorned his cloak with the flakes of heavenly frost. And so it was then that he wept."

 OMO.13.t: "The LORD's Word, for All to Hear"
 OMO.13.d: "In the ancient times of days since passed, it was through Emmanuel that the lowly and forsaken were given the arm by which to rise above the oppression of tyranny, violence, and sin. Christ's own Crucifixion served as the end of his mortal service on Earth; however, a new Vessel of the LORD walks amongst the meek and lowly, preparing to spread his word across all corners of this frozen world. It shall be the Day of Reckoning for every barbarian, tyrant, and cultist, as the Father journeys forward to bring the light of God to the fiendish wastes.\n\nAnd so greatly did the Father take up the podium of God, speaking out to the select few beside him, but with a voice heard round the taigas. "Brothers and Sisters of this bright world. Is it not we who bring forward the promises of God from the scriptures into the world? Yes, it is true: our home of Russia has come under the despair of bandits, dictators, and marauders. But know this, brothers and sisters: as it says in the scriptures, 'Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.' It is, thus, our duty to rise above the choking grasp of these tyrannical mad-men. For the mighty LORD seeks for justice to rise in our broken world, and we must be the first deliverer of judgement, in his name. From this hill of Omolon do we pray for all named Russian!"\n\nIt was thus that the Father's revelation came clear: no manner of pirate nor persecutor could seek to overturn the might of the LORD. The followers of Heaven thus marched on, rising above the chains of enslavement and oppression. However, while such men and women fought and killed for their freedom, the Father whispered softened words...\n\n"But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you.""
 OMO.13.a: "It is Heaven's hymns that we sing!"
 
 OMO.14.t: "Purging He Who Purges"
 OMO.14.d: "Thus sayeth the LORD, in the shape of Jesus Christ, the Son of God: "Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."\n\nDeep in the land of Irkutsk, when the soldiers of the LORD broke through and took the city, did a certain man, dragged to the city square, test our Father. "I am Genrikh Yagoda, proud servant of the Central Committee of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Punishing Hand of the Revolution, and he who rejects your false words!" did the man scream. The crowd screeched forth, demanding the man's immediate death for the LORD; however, so defiantly tall did the Father stand at the man's side, bending to meet the poor man's beaten face. "Be not afraid, my elder. For we seek not your death, but, merely, God's redemption of this sunken land. Perhaps you may join us for a step forward into a new life?"\n\nYet, a Wall of Sin came to meet the Father's eyes. "Do you all forget Bukharin? Alexander Men is nothing but a fraudulent cultist!" screamed the man named Yagoda, only to be met with the cries of a fierce peasantry, ready to tear him apart. "Be not afraid." the Father proclaimed, as he laid his hand upon the official, calling a grin deep from the clouds of Heaven.\n\nO God in Heaven, how surely does a coiled serpent strike? Thus was answered on that day, as the man's coat pocket revealed the Invention of Tokarev, aimed directly at the Father's skull. By God's greater light, however, this serpent was defanged, as a sharp click echoed through the frosted winds, followed by the thunderous silence of thousands of onlookers. 'Twas only when a child nigh older than her tenth year threw a stone into the man's skull in return did a hundred more follow, as the crowd birthed a mob that birthed a lynching.\n\nSo greatly did the Father weep, however, as his fingernails felt the scrapings against the Siberian stone of the ground, and his only warmth remaining flowing down his face from his eyes, praying to the Almighty that they may find redemption and lay down their thirst of angered blood."
 OMO.14.a: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
 
 OMO.15.t: "Proselytizing He Who Protests"
 OMO.15.d: "Thus sayeth the LORD: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh."\n\nHigh above did the banner of the Kingdom of God on Earth fly upon the march into the city of Ulan-Ude, where holiness had been disavowed and led, instead, by the values of a Revolution, a Revolution guided by man and man alone. So then did the Father climb the great steps in the Odigitrievsky Cathedral, where he ordered the defeated meet them. So here, in the great Cathedral of Our Lady of Smolensk, would the Father find those who stood defiant against the orders of the LORD!\n\nBut punish the young sailor whose eyes met him in those upper corridors. Rather, the goldenness of respects were given, as incenses were burned and the candles lit in honor of the Almighty. This child sought not the redemption towards God in Heaven; rather, he sought a guarantee for the rights of his people, the happiness of his people, the lives of his people. Honored was his soul despite damnation, and virtuous was his mission. How could one claim justice in the death of such a noble soul, willing to do all of God's work shedding his name?\n\nIn his mighty wisdom did the Father deliver the sailor child's penance: serve his court as a servant of the good LORD, and spread the good news and devotion to God wherever the Father himself went! Surely, however, did the Vessel of God recognize an utter lack of faith despite his acceptance of the absolution; nevertheless, so great did the Father witness his carrying out of good acts across the people of Russia, as he would have wanted all along."
 OMO.15.a: "The Unwilling made whole."
 
 OMO.16.t: "Nullifying He Who Negotiates"
 OMO.16.d: "Records of the fall of the abominable turned most blessed city of Magadan by the might of the holy God, in the Year of Our Lord, [GetYear], set down by Scribe Sergius, once the follower of the dark way of Fascism, Matkovsky...\n\nIt was the Seventh hour of the new day when the Church bells first rang, awakening the townspeople and beginning preparations for the new day, for both the native Russians and all manner of foreign mercenaries. It was only by the Eleventh hour, however, that the sun began to shine across the city, and thus give light upon the christened forces of the North. Thus was when every armed man, mercenary and native alike, drew to the city walls, preparing for the potential outbreak of violence that could consume the city, and bring ruin to every family inside. It was Matkovsky who organized these men, as the bright sun shone down on every potential combatant that day, shining a great light upon the Father, as he drew closer to the gates of Magadan as if wandering the gates of Heaven.\n\nFurthermore, it was Matkovsky who marched downwards through the City Gates, realizing the sharp truth regarding the bloodbath which had been prophesied to follow for weeks on end now. This was it, the time was now for Magadan to siege hell against the Northern invaders who sought to undo the progress of the local leader, Matkovsky. And maybe, just maybe, could he secure for himself a means of escape if everything went according to plan.\n\nThe next few hours shed an ocean of blood deep into the Siberian snow. Americans, Germans, South Africans, and Russians themselves all found themselves fighting and dying on the Gate of Magadan that day, all of whom had carried the rifle to bear against the Shield of Christ that day. Nevertheless, they all found themselves at the mercy of the merciful Father that day, with the Matkovsky having been caught in a damaged vehicle in a dash to escape the burning city. So great was the LORD that day to provide his mercy, to provide a new light of life for the once-living Matkovsky: to be the Scribe Sergius, destined to follow the Father's holy hymn throughout the lands of Russia."

 OMO.17.t: "Managing He Who Maddens"
 OMO.17.d: "Thus sayeth the LORD: "To speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people."\n\nO Zeya, how great were you to the gifts of gold towards these Russian lands, and how daring you were in conquering your own sea! Neverlonger, however, could the city be resigned to the likeness of the Imperial and the Fascist, denying the lordliness of the Scripture in exchange for barbarism and butchery! Thus, did the Father set forth, and in his victories did he claim this aquatic foundation, where the wretchedness of demons wrought of Fascism lurked across the land, the leader of whom having been brought directly to the Father in chains. It was here that such a demon swore upon the bible of the justice in his actions, denying our Father...it was here that such a demon revoked the words of our Father, denying him his glory and seeking notions of godlihood himself...and, finally, this is where the demon spat upon the boots of our Father, in one final insult, denying our Father for the third time. This was when the demon was brought to a private quarters for our Father to find council with personally.\n\nNo man listening upon the conversation that occurred that day. Was it the sacrament of confession, followed by holy absolution? Was it the discussion of the philosopher and the poet? Was it the opening up of the gates of heavens upon this miserable soul's shadow? None may know. What all remember, however, was the transformation of this demon back into the image of a mere man: a man wrought with grief, awaiting and embracing the noose held in the crowd's hands that day. Thus did the followers of the Almighty whisper that day: were such fates just in the eyes of the LORD, or were the tears of the Father enough to show grave mistakes in their actions?"
 OMO.17.a: "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy."
 
 OMO.18.t: "Pardoning He who is a Prisoner"
 OMO.18.d: "Thus sayeth the LORD: "Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body."\n\nOur Father descended in the land known as Chita once more, shoulder-to-shoulder to the servants of the God Almighty who sought to liberate the revolutionary city from the clutches of men gone mad with power, as whispers of a Tsar crowned upon a throne crossed rivers and valleys and into our Father's ear, ready to liberate the oppressed from a tyrant once more. So greatly did the children of Omolon descend upon the city that day, fighting bravely to secure a new age of justice and prosperity under the watchful eyes of the LORD for this greatly battered land!\n\nHowever, it was in the palace of this falsified emperor's empire that the truth gave way under the light of the Almighty. A band of traitors led this land, citing the legal texts of warfare and militancy as their gospel, and proclaiming an innocent soul as being their leader, one who greatly wept at the bloodshed, calling for his return home 'cross the great seas. Consolation set forth across all Russians that day, as the soldiers of Omolon collected the band of despots ruling over this land whilst our Father so greatly convened with the man held hostage by his own heritage. Such life was not fit for this man; such prisonership was no life for any man.\n\nAnd thus, leaving behind a trail of hanged men, did this foreigner once more set sail for his home. So dutifully did he cross the Okhotsk, and then to the Pacific! And finally, after many days of rest, thought, and prayer, did this man find himself back into his warm, forgiving home. Embracing his family, all this man was able to recount to his friends and loved ones were the texts given to him by the Holy Liberator upon the sacred Orthodox Scripture."
 OMO.18.a: "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
 
 OMO.19.t: "The Labor of the Lord"
 OMO.19.d: "It was not through the lackadaisical, sullen look upon the world that the LORD was able to forge the majesty of creation; rather, it was by his mighty, golden hand, willing to bring light and life to all plants, all animals, and all of mankind that he was able to bring about such a perfectly imperfect universe. In this way, it is through the mighty work of our Father, the Vessel of our God, that we are able to find ourselves the heroic leaders of this great expanse, giving all in Russia a holy light to look upon for guidance and salvation in the shadow of these dark times.\n\nTwas upon the frosted crystal of the high cathedral that our Father looked upon the fruit of his people upon the bank of the Omolon. The lost, the abandoned, the weak, transformed under the light of Heaven into the mighty soldiers of the Only begotten Son, born forth into a fractured world to bring forth the Kingdom of God to Earth once more, as foretold in the Book of Revelations. O, words of prophets hath not foretold of the blessed acts our Father would lead us through, from the disposal of the sinful despot to the assimilation of a new, former land of misguided souls into our mighty dominion! Only by the mighty Spear of Emmanuel shall we learn of prestige, power, and piety destined to us by our LORD.\n\nOur Father, absorbing the great and terrible deeds performed by his leadership, rested. He thought clearly upon a single image, ruminating in his head since this great journey started so long ago: that of the rainbow. Not prophetic nor apocalyptic scriptures gouging for reclamation and vindication, but the truest showcase of God our Father could muster in his mind: beautiful, awe-inspiring, and loving. And yet, on looking at the fire profusing from his followers words and deeds, what would come next for him in this world?"

 OMO_father_regional: "The Divine Mandate of Siberia"

 OMO.20.t: "The Sermon of the Prisoners"
 OMO.20.d: "Thus sayeth the Gospel according to Luke: "The spirit of the lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free those who are oppressed."\n\n"How corrupted must one's soul be to deserve imprisonment? Ought a schoolchild failing an exam from stress be thrown into the Siberian depths for the failures of his labor? Brothers and Sisters, I say to you today that coal-filled depths of this slave camp, built to forge railroads and produce riches with which none here may keep, houses not criminals, but mistreated Brothers and Sisters, just like you or I. Imagine a reckless, smiling child falling deep into the depths of the Lake Baikal. Would it be our duty, as parents to children of this world, to hold the child under, to allow the frostbite and drowning to suffice as punishment for his mistakes? Or would it not be right to fight for our child, to rescue him and ensure his soul is secured in this right, and aid him to become better throughout all his efforts. This is how we ought to, no, how we must treat these fallen men who've frozen in their own Lake Baikal for so long, as the soot has burned their lungs and the callouses enveloped their hands. Let them be in the midst of you or me, and we shall lead them to a new life."\n\nIt was then that all manner of man, woman, and child set forth to labor into the depths of the Amurlag. No longer slaves breaking rocks at the crack of the whip; no, these were God's chosen, freeing and releasing those brothers and sisters deemed "dangerous" by tyrants long past, and allowing them to become Children of the LORD."
 OMO.20.a: "Amen."
 
 OMO.21.t: "Through A Glass, Darkly"
 OMO.21.d: "In the days of the Hebrew children God approached His chosen, appearing in vast whirlwinds and melting mountains with His holy light. But with the ascent of Christ these miracles were no longer in abundance. So the Father prayed, as he had always done, for guidance. Just as the Prophets had done, the voice of God within him spilled through the small spaces of the heart. A smiling woman nursing her son in the light of a Church's medical bay. A peasant rebuilding a torn-down tenement with the aid of smiling worker-priests. A repentant sinner anointing the world with joy in the Godless Nations to the West, where the Tyrants yet reigned in their delusions.\n\nThese, and more, the Father prayed for. His heart, like an alabaster jar, spilled open to intercession - and to revival, should it prove necessary.\n\nNot long had he prayed before he was shown the treatment even Paul had not been offered in all his years of service. The Lord brought his eyes to a pool, somewhere in a deep forest, and as he looked, he cried out: for the image he beheld in its reflection was none other than the Christos Pantokrator. Emperor of the Universe! Triumph of David! His voice spoke syllables at one with the speech of angels, and as he trembled, the warm touch of the Savior embraced him: not in judgement, but in love.\n\nCome, my servant, the Lord whispered. Look again. And the image of the pool was none other than that of his own father. I love you, he whispered - and then the Father was Father no longer, but Alexander Men, the burning eyed boy who loved his parents and God with a zeal fierce enough to shake the heavens themselves. He reached out, and as he touched the face it became his own.\n\nThe Father rose in a cold sweat, his ears ringing with the touch of the Divine, and he whispered: Blessed is the lion whom the man shall devour, that the lion shall become man. And accursed is the man whom the lion shall devour -"

 OMO.22.t: "The Poor Man"
 OMO.22.d: "One day, Father Alexander was invited to the village of Zashchishchen Bogom (which means "Protected by God") for their harvest festival. There the villagers welcomed His intercessor with a bountiful feast and fine, colorful raiment. Man, woman and child rejoiced in their liberator's wake, grasping at his robes for some measure of the divine energy its linen had soaked. The village elders themselves offered their own hall, twice taller than any other building in Zashchinshchen Bogom, for the Father to rest his head and sate his hunger in.\n\nIt was then that he noticed a man in tattered robes just outside the village gates. On his soil-caked arms was a woven basket full of steamed potatoes. Imploring eyes glinted past his shambled locks, and past the crowd that stood at least ten paces away from him. Intrigued, Father Men asked an elder, "Who is that man outside your palisades? And why dare he not seek refuge within?"\n\n"A trifling matter Father," replied the old man. "We here have learned not to bother with Yegor the Mad. That he'd lost his wife and children saddens us, but grief is no excuse for slovenly appearances." Then the elder guided the Father to the hall - but his hand met empty air.\n\nFor the Father was halfway through the hall and Yegor when the elders and villagers gathered their wits. One shouted, "Where are you going, Father Men?"\n\nWithout glancing back he said, "Why, to partake in the blessings of Yegor, son of God. My belly shall be sated by his humble feast, and my clothes shall be kept dry by the thatch of his roof. Keep your stone walls and suckled pigs; the LORD has no use for blessings He cannot share to all.""

 OMO.23.t: "The Skeptic Child"
 OMO.23.d: "Father Alexander took with him three disciples to Omolon's square. He gestured at the faithful going about their day, at the markets brimming with fruits and cuts of meat, at the trees and open blue sky risen above concrete grey facades. "Tell me, Stefan, Artem, Kuzma," he said, "to whom shall we give credit for the prosperity we see?"\n\n"Surely 'tis your strength, Father?" rhetorically asked Stefan. "It takes no small fortitude to endure Siberia's climes and emerge a war's victor against all odds." Never to mince words, Artem chided, "Are you daft, Stefan? Did not the Prophets say that the strongest are those with knowledge and wisdom? Then it should stand to reason that the Father's intellect had borne the fruits around us." Kuzma offered his own thoughts after Stefan and Artem exhausted themselves. "I find it hard to believe Father Alexander would have succeeded without gift of gab. We petty men are nothing without his Heaven-touched words."\n\nIt was then that a small eavesdropper moseyed onto their dialogue. The child looked the Father's robed figure up and down and said, "You look fat and dumb and clumsy."\n\nFather Alexander let out a hearty chuckle while he ruffled the runt's raven mop. "Then you're wiser than three of my disciples put together!" He turned towards bristling Stefan, Artem, and Kuzma after shooing the child off. "Remember the LORD's teachings you three," the Father continued. "'I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.' My brawn, my brains and tongue are merely branches for His supple fruits. Thus shall we give thanks not to any earthly king or prophet - but to the King of Kings in Heaven alone.""

 OMO.24.t: "The Sickly Man"
 OMO.24.d: "On a snowy clearing outside of Omolon did the army of the faithful congregate. Before them stood Father Alexander Men, leading today's Liturgy. He had donned a kontorasson over his form-fitting robes, with a small three-barred crucifix hanging to below his chest as it jangled against icy winds. Yet Siberia's gales deterred them little from hearing the word of God.\n\nBoots crunching snow, however, did. The Father was halfway through today's Ektenia when he caught one of the soldiers trudging towards him, head hung low like a bandit awaiting the executioner's axe. He set aside his Bible. "What ails you, my son?" he asked.\n\nThe man had neared, enough so the Father could glimpse the emblem emblazoned on his ushanka. His lips pursed thin. Must be why the flock had given their fellow a wide berth.\n\n"Prokhor Volkov," he said without prompting. "NKVD."\n\n"Do you wish for confession, child?" A wordless nod. "Then let the LORD and the LORD alone hear your sins."\n\nThe words exchanged between them were lost to posterity. What the flock would forever hold to their hearts, however, was Bukharin's erstwhile thug collapsed against the Father as a sobbing heap. The priest rubbed circles around the frail man's back all throughout."

When he didn't have the power nor will to defeat the fascist devils and atheist communists, Sudoplatov came.\n\nAnd yet, the danger has only begun. While Sudoplatov may be a powerful figure, able to give much to the Father, he is also as dangerous as the snake. While we use Sudoplatov's connections that lead us to victory, at the same time he could be collecting his power, waiting to strike.\n\nThe Father should beware Sudoplatov, however, he has not done anything wrong yet, only helping the Father and his forces to victory. Without Sudoplatov, will he ever see victory? Perhaps Sudoplatov should be used to his fullest extent.

However, he didn't think Sudoplatov would grow as powerful as he did. But it was apparent Men had underestimated Sudoplatov, and in the eyes of God, he failed.\n\nIt happened quickly, almost too quickly. Sudoplatov, with the help of former NKVD agents, quickly swept over those loyal to the Father and reached Alexander Men as he slept. Sudoplatov didn't want to kill Men, wishing more to threaten him into being a puppet. Unfortunately, things did not go smoothly.\n\nSudoplatov knew Men had to live if Siberia were to live as well. And yet, all it took were three bullets to end the Divine Mandate. No one knew if the NKVD agent that shot Men just hated him or was caught up in the moment, but all could see Alexander Men now lying dead in a pool of blood, and their chances at power swept. The tempter in his moment had failed to secure the power he once promised to Alexander Men.\n\nWith the Father dead, the end of the mandate is upon us, and Sudoplatov has fled deep into Siberia with those loyal to him.

 OMO.29.d: "Amidst the endless warfare of the Russian Far East, few men have bothered to pay attention to the frigid lands to the north. Beyond a few abandoned mining towns, isolated Chukchi villages and wandering nomads, the area was assumed to be more or less abandoned. A few madmen were said to occasionally find their way up there, attempting to establish their own "empire" in the cold, but the land bitterly refused to be tamed.\n\nThis state of anarchy has now ended.\n\nIt began with the hymns. Travellers brought tales of entire villages united in prayer, singing songs of hope and peace in the name of the Lord. This hardly seemed unusual - Russia has been a godly land even through the days of the Union. But when many travellers all began speaking the same tales coming from so many different villages, our leaders began to suspect that something was amiss. Now, we know why.\n\nAn emissary has arrived in our midst from the now united north. He came only to deliver a message - a message of judgement delivered from his master, the so-called "Father Men". This Father has proclaimed the entirety of the north to belong to a single union in the name of God. Declaring that we have committed grievous sin and besmirched the lands of Holy Russia, he has vowed to lead his flock of faithful against us and deliver unto us two things. Divine wrath, and divine salvation.\n\nWe had hoped that this was some trick, but already our scouts are reporting movement on the northern borders. The north is indeed coming, and their hymns grow louder and louder by the day. We must ready our forces to meet this army of zealots head on.\n\nIt would seem, however, that there are some amongst us who would rather leave this place and pledge their life in the name of this mad crusade."

 OMO.30.d: ""Father, it is very good to see you," Sudoplatov said as Alexander Men stepped through the door into the small room. "Have a seat, there are some... things I wish to talk about."\n\nMen sat down in the small chair, saying coldly, "I believe it is I who has something to say first, Sudoplatov." Men paused, watching Sudoplatov's reaction. "Are you betraying me, Pavel?"\n\n"What, I would never, where are you getting these ideas?" Sudoplatov said unaware Men knew of his plot. This was supposed to go the other way around! Had he miscalculated?\n\n"Well, it appears your NKVD divisions are taking your orders, not mine." Men said. "You've also been collecting funds and my generals are reporting weapons disappearing. I believe you've gained too much power, Sudoplatov. Chadek, Clovis, come in here, please. Your temptations have failed to turn me and you have betrayed no one but God himself." Men stood up to leave Sudoplatov to his fate.\n\nSudoplatov dropped to the feet of Men, begging. "Wait, I'll repent! I'll repent! Please, I was just trying to give us a chance at actually reunifying Russia. I promise I'll remain loyal, please."\n\nMen looked down at the man at his feet. He was sure Sudoplatov was hiding something. Was he really repenting, or was it all a lie? Still, Men was always supposed to forgive, wasn't he? Would it be hypocritical to let Sudoplatov rot in some cell?"

With no central command in the theocracy, there is nothing stopping us from unifying the Far East under our banner. We must strike immediately, before another demagogue rises and threatens the unity of Siberia!"

 OMO.33.t: "The Spring of Heaven Most High"
 OMO.33.d: "It was upon the Seventh day of the LORD's week that our Father looked upon the lowly and formerly disheartened who now joined alongside his holy dominion in hopes of bringing about a new era of Christian devotion. In his wisdom, however, he knew so easily that not all were so devoted to the Church and the belief in God; rather, it was the fiery image of unity which they clinged to, politics over religion, action over faith. And, yet, with the smiling faces and brightened days brought upon so many, our Father could not help but feel the pull of the LORD most closely, rather than deciding to kneel down to the unfaithful.\n\nIt was thus that our Father found himself descending the grand staircase of his grander cathedral, and finding himself trudging through the endless frosted snowfall to reach the city square upon the bank of the Omolon. As the farmhand and the soldier looked on, and the crowd began to form, it was our Father who mounted the podium donning the square. Here, our great Father finally got a closer, more personal look into so many of his followers' beautiful, captivating eyes, and he finally began to perform the holy sanctities as he foresaw them. Assembled, stepping down and working throughout the crowd, speaking softly into the ear with a kind hand upon their soldier. The people were calmed, they were blessed, and they were happy. For this mass was not like the ones ignited by the fire of conquest by some of these meek folk; rather, this was one of joy, of tranquility, of peace.\n\nIt was here that our Father noticed some of the more retreated faces of the unfaithful, looking down upon the Earth as if in shame, in regret. And it was here that our Father navigated towards them, and embraced them: for difference and disagreement shall not tear a family asunder."
 OMO.33.a: "Make Holy the Sabbath."
 
 OMO.34.t: "Fear Not He Who Holds thine Hand"
 OMO.34.d: "It was upon the Seventh day of the LORD's week that our Father looked upon the lowly and formerly disheartened who now joined alongside his holy dominion in hopes of bringing about a new era of Christian devotion. In his wisdom, however, he knew so easily that not all were so devoted to the Church and the belief in God; rather, it was the fiery image of unity which they clinged to, politics over religion, action over faith. It was knowing this that guided our Father upon what to do, as in knowing that not every man was so pious among a land of the devout called for a compromise for the betterment of all man.\n\nThus, it was shown that the most devoted and the most fervent believers of the faith of our God, the Holy Trinity who gave way for our life were assembled earlier than all others for the Mass that day. Some offered scorn and insult against the other men and women who labored early and could not, or chose not, to attend the Holy Assembly; however, with our Father's guiding words, they were hushed from all disrespect. Mass was made with haste and with purpose, allowing for the devotee to Emmanuel to find himself able to worship in spirit. All others of Omolon watched as the Father concluded his rushed Mass far earlier than the others, striking a note of confusion and fear within some of the peasantry who had assembled in worrying what the Father may have planned for those who disregarded the mass, fearing as all others had feared for disagreement in years prior.\n\nBut persecution was not the answer, nor the heavy hand of oppression and scorn. No, rather, it was the hour to assemble for the poor, the lowly, and the hungry of their land. Every servant to our Father and thus our LORD came that day, bearing gifts of bread and soup and pleasantries to be handed out to all who starved on the streets of Omolon. And sang and praised and feasted they did, as the notes of Church Hymns alongside the Russian folksong gave joy to the mind of our Father."
 OMO.34.a: "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
 
 OMO.35.t: "Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as Thyself"
 OMO.35.d: "It was upon the Seventh day of the LORD's week that our Father looked upon the lowly and formerly disheartened who now joined alongside his holy dominion in hopes of bringing about a new era of Christian devotion. In his wisdom, however, he knew so easily that not all were so devoted to the Church and the belief in God; rather, it was the fiery image of unity which they clinged to, politics over religion, action over faith. In his primary duty to the LORD above all, our Father knew it was right to render obedience to him and him alone; however, was it not truly right to serve the crowds of unbelievers out there, who commit to good works in this life despite a lack of faith?\n\nThis question tested our Father as he stepped down from his living quarters and descended from his cathedral on the bank of the Omolon, where night skies still hung over an early morning. All manner of devotees made their way to his doorstep for morning Mass; yet, it was not what they found. Rather, our Father recognized the need to forge a new assembly for all men, rather than just his select devoted. And thus did he muster men of all kinds to assemble a new experience to enjoy, one found not oft within the frozen lands of Siberia: that of a festival. Of course, the LORD Almighty was showcased in some of the imagery at the festival that day, but never was it made to be the end-all be-all for the assembled that day. Nay, for it was the duty of all who assembled that day to love and drink and feast and make merry, as was right for them to do, and enjoy themselves in their fractured state of this world.\n\nNevertheless, our Father abandoned not his hardworking children. For when they had come to believe that they must abandon the Sabbath that day, it was our Father who picked them up through the night, and assembled them into his cathedral. And there they celebrated the sacraments, broke bread and gave thanks, and made peace with the LORD, in the quiet of the night."
 OMO.35.a: "You have multiplied the nation and increased its joy."
 
 OMO.36.t: "The LORD is My Strength and My Shield"
 OMO.36.d: "The riverbank of Omolon held not the lowly city of those abandoned by tyrants of olde days yonder; no, for this had become far more under the guiding love of God Almighty. A dominion of the devoted, a dominion of laborers, soldiers, fathers, and sons, and a dominion of Emmanuel himself. All to be had under the Vessel of our God, our Father himself. Yet, Omolon hadn't contained the work of our Father to just a riverbank; rather, this fortress of God stretched across the Russian nation, for all to hear and rejoice!\n\nHowever, the marauder, the despot, and the cultist gave not cries of glory and salvation; rather, they cried with a burning hate, as they prepared their arms and ammunitions for the days to come, and the deciding fate of the land of God's chosen, having come so far from the depths of the tundra to bring forth the light of the LORD. Nevermore was this to be a land of destruction wrought by the wrathful and the persecutor, for this was to be God's Kingdom on Earth, and it is under the banner of Our Father that we shall guide ourselves towards such redemption for all who would bear the name Russian. The peaceful, loving, tranquil nature of our LORD was never to be dismissed through all we had done; however, the men of our world do not understand such notions taught throughout the scriptures, and thus necessitated the just hand of a more Old Testament, bringing forth the justice and fear of our God through the fields of war, so that we may triumph over the conquests of Gehenna in this battered world.\n\nThe burning fields gave no images of power and glory to the mind of our Father, however. As he continued to stare, he knew this was no way for mankind to act to one another, to tear each other apart without retraction. One day, this world would see the last of its war and embrace one another in the workings of our LORD's love. And on that day, our Father swore, he would rest."
 OMO.36.a: "Blessed be the Peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."

 OMO.37.t: "Evil Made Flesh"
 OMO.37.d: "Thus sayeth the LORD, by the hand of Isaiah: ""Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees, and the writers who keep writing oppression, to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!"\n\nNaught but whispers adorned the shining crest of OMOLON, whereupon our Father knelt, whereupon our Father prayed, and whereupon our Father wept. The wicked claws of Lucifer's inferno had gripped the harrowed Earth time and again, as the teachings of the Theologians and Priests journeyed through the mind of the teary-eyed Father. Echoes of the Antichrist, as they had been declared by the scribes, have come time and again to haunt the world in their deadly shadows of Sin: the Mad Emperor who dared watch Rome burn, the drunken Tsar who threw his wrath down on his son, the She-Queen who bathed in the blood of her people, and even the "Master of Europe" upon the throne of the Eagle-Empire. Yet, none had reached such heights of being as sickening, as depraved, as wretched, and as wicked as the Born-Again Nebuchadnezzar to the West, he who leaves naught but an inferno in his maddened wrath, in the search for his long-dead King. He who would not, nay, could not reign over the lands of Russia, lest the world burn upon his Throne of Insanity! Hours of prayer, hours of praying to the LORD, all had led our Father to raise his head, and gaze upon the face of the crucified LORD in the chapel, and realize one grave truth: this was the Abomination of Desolation. He who would oppose Christ himself. This was no Echo of the Antichrist, but the Antichrist himself.\n\nThus did our Father grip his robe so tightly, crying out in anguish towards the countless souls butchered under this Abaddon's wicked gaze. And thus did our Father cry out to all men and women that day, readying all who gazed and listening to march to war, not for the glory of OMOLON, but to shield the world from Azazel's wickedness!"
 OMO.37.a: "For the Greater Glory of GOD!"

 OMO.38.t: "Against the Winds"
 OMO.38.d: "Russia, after years of constant warfare, of the oppression of Bolshevism and Fascism, of the tyranny of warlords, knows true peace. The people, that once were led by false prophets, and insidious ideologies that brought no contentment to a hungry soul finally know peace in God's tender guidance.\n\nAnd yet, why does Men's heart weigh so much?\n\nAlexander Men, the Father, guider of the lost and the poor, is mortal and fallible as the rest; for what manner of Shepard feels no fear or anxiety over their growing flock? What were once dozens, escalated into hundreds, thousands, and the millions. Each and everyone looks to him like a guiding star, a symbol for hope long lost even before Hitler, thrice-cursed his name, brought the gates of Hell towards Russia and her faithful.\n\nThe Reich. Germany. That's the source of his fear. The winds coming from the West bring more chills and frostbite than the harshest Siberian winter, for the west lies Moskowien, the forgotten people of Russia, living in a state of fear and submission over the Eagle Empire's Banner.\n\nIt wouldn't end here, and Alexander knew it. The Shade of the Anti-Christ would not tolerate the existence of his eternal enemy near him, and no good man would not gaze away and let his people suffer under the heirs of the Snake that denied Humanity their place in Paradise.\n\nUnder the Cross did the humble shepherd prayers intensify, hands whitening as he grasps the Chaplet with all strength he can muster. Men couldn't turn his gaze away from the Russians still under the Masters of Europe. And so he prayed, for the souls that were lost, to the souls still to be lost, and the souls he could save in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."
 OMO.38.a: "Amen."
