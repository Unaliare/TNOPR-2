 PER_German_Persian_Oil_Company:0 "Deutsch-Persische Ölgesellschaft"
 PER_German_Persian_Oil_Company_desc:0 "Originally the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, ownership of the corporation was transferred to Germany during the division of the British Empire at the end of the Second World War. Rebranded as the Deutsch-Persische Ölgesellschaft (DPÖ), the Company controls every drop of oil in Iran and dictates what pittance of the profit we receive from its sales."
 PER_Mosaddeghs_Legacy:0 "Mosaddegh's Legacy"
 PER_Mosaddeghs_Legacy_desc:0 "Our nation still vividly remembers the 1953 Coup against the government of then Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. Orchestrated by Germany following Mosaddegh's nationalisation of the DPÖ, many both domestically and internationally view the coup as the death of Iranian democracy. With the installation of a Pro-German regime and the Shah greatly empowered, the trust between our government and the people will take a long time to heal, should it ever heal at all."
 PER_The_Imperial_Guard:0 "The Imperial Guard"
 PER_The_Imperial_Guard_desc:0 "Fiercely loyal to the Shah, the Imperial Guard are the most elite combat units in the Middle East. Acting as the Shah's personal guard and serving as an elite branch of the army, many of our nation's finest soldiers come from its ranks. With some of the most modern equipment, harshest training and strictest recruitment tests in the world they are the true heirs to the Persian Immortals of old."
 PER_The_Iranian_Civil_War:0 "The Iranian Civil War"
 PER_The_Iranian_Civil_War_desc:0 "Iran is in chaos. Scores of men, women and children die every day in combat and in the crossfire. The divisions of this ancient society will be made whole through blood, and only then perhaps will the Iranian people know peace. But is it all worth it?"

 POLITICS_MOHAMMAD_REZA_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "Mohammad Reza Pahlavi is a blank canvas. The Shah is not truly a human being, to the people of Iran. To his supporters, he is the symbol of Persia, and its unceasing sprint to the modern horizon. He is Cyrus, looking at the anarchic ruins of Babylon from his chariot - not as a conquering tyrant, but as a modernizing liberator. Like the King of Kings before him, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was given a patch infertile dirt to make a bountiful orchard, strewn with fat figs and ripe fruits of every kind. The Shah is Persia's iron will, it's steely resolve against insurmountable odds.\n\nTo his detractors, the Shah is Darius the Third incarnate, his own feeble mind more than outmatched by the would-be Alexanders of Germania. To his enemies, the Shah is not a King of Kings but a German satrap -and a brutal one at that. Iran is no longer the envy of the world, Where glimmering, shining palaces on the hill once stood, inhabited by men of discipline and wisdom now only stand decrepit tombs to old glory, where an old man lives in delusion. The Shah is Persia's eternal reminder of how far its people have truly fallen.\n\nTo Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, he is neither of these figures. The Shah does not seek to emulate the past glories of ages gone by- and he will not suffer the defeats of it either. Iran is a dying, decrepit nation. Nothing underlined this fact like the Iranian capitulation to Germania, after Mossadegh's nationalisation of the oil fields and exile of the monarch. When the Germans restored control over the nation, and restored him to the throne, the Shah saw the truth. Iran can no longer cling to its past, in the vain hope of saving its future. No longer could he hide behind his persona of a drunken play boy partying in the Swiss Alps. No longer could he bask beneath his father's- the Reza Shah - long, blood-stained shadow. Every day Germania grows weaker and weaker, and their hold over Iran's oilfields becomes more fragile. When the day comes, the Shah will walk into Iran's golden age, as a modernised world power. Not as a half-remembered idol to its weakness, but as Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, King of Kings.\n\nThe Shah may be a blank canvas, but the most beautiful works have always sprung from an empty sheet of paper."
 POLITICS_FARAH_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "Farah Pahlavi is the Shahbanu, Empress of the Imperial State of Iran. As a daughter to wealthy parents Farah's upbringing was a privileged one, full of opportunities that common Iranians could only dream of. She met the Shah as a student of architecture in the Reich, and they were married in an opulent ceremony which caused her country's Treasury some strain. For ten years and more the Shah ruled over Iran, and Farah enjoyed all the glamour and luxury that was due the Empress. She was not idle during this time, working to improve the lot of Iranian women and fostering cultural initatives.\n\nThen her world was set aflame. With her husband's death Farah Pahlavi became Regent of the Imperial State, watching her country collapse into civil war. The Shahbanu is known to favour the German language over Persian; more importantly, she represents an establishment dedicated to German-Iranian friendship, and the continued provision of oil to the Reich.\n\nNow the Empress presides over a throne stained in blood, as German guns and German bombers reduce her country to rubble. To the Generals and SAVAK men who support her regency, the Empress is a stabilising figure, the last hope that the 2500 year monarchy will survive. The Empress herself can only watch as §Rmore and more people are butchered in her name§!."
 POLITICS_SHAPOUR_BAKHTIAR_DESC:0 "Shapour Bakhtiar has never asked for much from his opponents. Where the other claimants to Iranian leadership have denounced the Shah, Bakhtiar sought only to keep the monarchy in place with a constitution. For every call for blood he has called for moderation, reconciliation, and peace. For this many of the Iranian people revile him as an apologist for tyranny. They could not be more wrong.\n\nFor Bakhtiar has more than earned his stripes as a freedom fighter. During the Spanish Civil War, he had fought on the side of the ill-fated Republic. When the Germans subdued France, Bakhtiar used his contacts among the French Resistance to undermine the occupier. Now Bakhtiar fights for his own country, and he is determined that he shall not fight for the losing side another time. All he has ever wanted is for his people to be free, and to be led by a good man towards this goal. Only death will stop him."
 POLITICS_SHER_MOHAMMED_MARRI_DESC:0 "Sher Mohammed is a Marri chief of Baluchestan. As leader of the Baluchi Liberation Front, he has pioneered guerrilla warfare against all those who would encroach on the independence of the Baluch. A proud Sunni people in a nation of Shia, with their own language, culture and tradition, the millions of Baluchi have long been ruled by people who do not understand them. To this nationalist motivation Sher Mohammed adds a Marxist interpretation, seeing his people's struggle as yet another in the eternal fight against the oppressor.\n\nPerhaps their fight is doomed to failure from the beginning. The enemy has overwhelming superiority in both men and arms. It matters not. They will pay with blood for every inch of these mountains."

 PER_GER.1.d:0 "Shahbanu Pahlavi,\n\nWe know the enemy coalition amassed against you is tremendous, and that you are outnumbered. In this vital hour, you can not under any circumstances lose faith and give in to foreign and domestic pressures! You must stand your ground; even in the face of such opposition.\n\nOur government is mobilizing aid, including men, as you read this. The first wave of Wehrmacht volunteers should be arriving shortly, followed by a steady stream of supplies. Until then, the Imperial army must hold its favorable positions. The enemy alliance arrayed against you is fragil; time is against them. Their unity will waver, sooner or later. Until that time arrives, we will stand by you in your hour of need."
