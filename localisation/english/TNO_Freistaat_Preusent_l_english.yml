 POLITICS_Adolf_Eichmann_DESC:0 "The Death's Head will march on. For purity. For unity. For the Aryan Race. No matter how many need to bleed to do it.\n\nOtto-Adolf Eichmann was born a German, worked as a German, fought as a German, and killed as a German. Originally from Prussia but rising through the ranks of his father's Austrian mining business after being pulled away from school, Eichmann's closest form of solidarity came through the right-wing militias and paramilitaries all of his friends had been talking about, and the bold words of the NSDAP flashing across the Newspaper headlines. Germany was destined for greatness, in young Adolf's mind, and it was his time to participate, and participate he did, as Eichmann was charged with personally sicking the dogs of war, brutal deportation, and genocide against thousands upon thousands of Jews. With the powerlessness of the Allies preventing anything from stopping him, Eichmann bathed in the blood of the Hebrews as a Grand Master and Architect of the most horrific slaughter of Jews the world had ever seen.\n\nHowever, the years of joyful bloodshed were cinched tightly by the collapsing successes of the Reich. Economic mishandlings, military failures in Russia, and a near-collapse of the German government had shaken the entire Aryan spirit, driving Eichmann towards swearing allegiance towards the newly formed Ordensstaat. For, if the Vaterland would trade the sword for the shackle, perhaps the Reichsführer-SS would employ Eichmann where he worked best, as he became the new SS-Obergruppenführer over the SS-Totenkopfverbände, leading the "Death's Heads" to a bloody, new Final Solution.\n\nHowever, all of the successes and accomplishments for Eichmann have come to fold, as the entirety of the Reich finds itself embattled against itself. To the East, the Blonde Beast leads in apocalyptic bookings of doom and despair towards Eichmann's former master, the Reichsführer-SS. Of course, Eichmann could never give into the wishes of someone willing to end the world, if that were true of course, however, a new goal rises upon the horizon. The degenerate Untermenschen surrounds the SS-Totenkopfverbände in broken shackles, and the time has come to reignite the Endlösung."

 FSP_no_regrets:0 "No Regrets"
 FSP_no_regrets_desc:0 "Ask, and Eichmann will characterize himself as a dedicated bureaucrat and loyal National Socialist. However, this is not the whole picture; he is also a cold-blooded, hateful ideologue, and encourages his men to follow suit."
 
 FSP_second_solution:0 "A Second Solution"
 FSP_second_solution_desc:0 "Eichmann's mission in Prussia is simple: to permanently excise all degeneracy. He has returned to his old methods of extermination and broadened their scope to include all who fail to live up to the ideals of the SS."
