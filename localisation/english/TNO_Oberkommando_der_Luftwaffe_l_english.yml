 POLITICS_JOHANNES_STEINHOFF_DESC:0 "One of the highest scoring Luftwaffe pilots of the Second World War, Johannes Steinhoff served over Britain during Operation Sea Lion before being transferred to the Eastern Front until the end of the war. His decorated combat history led him to be picked as a test pilot for the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter shortly after the end of the war. Despite his formidable skill in the air, an accident on the ground led to the fuel tanks of his Me 262 bursting into flames, the munitions on board detonating as well. Steinhoff was barely able to drag himself out of the burning aircraft, clinging to life and severely disfigured. However, he managed to survive and, after spending several years in the hospital to undergo reconstructive surgery, rejoined the Luftwaffe as an officer and instructor in the late 40's.\n\nBy 1962, Steinhoff had risen to the rank of Generalleutnant, becoming one of the most influential figures in the German Luftwaffe. During his tenure as an officer and instructor, he placed a strict focus on pilot training, which led to a notable decrease in the air force's accident rate. He aligned himself with Hermann Göring during the German Civil War, due to his longstanding position as Supreme Commander of the Luftwaffe. Unfortunately for him, Göring's bid for the Führership failed, leaving Steinhoff as one of the highest ranking Luftwaffe officers remaining at the war's end. As Germany's internal power struggle continues, he and his remaining consolidated Luftwaffe forces are stranded in and around Regensburg, surrounded by vicious and bloodthirsty SS warlords. With fuel and supplies limited, and the local air bases completely overfilled, air missions are only done out of necessity to protect the territory they have carved out for themselves. All they can hope for is survival."

 OKL_bingo_on_fuel_desc:0 "The once mighty Messerschmitt Factory and Oil Refinery of Regensburg was bombed to a crisp during the Civil War, and the SS paid no mind to repairing the hollowed-out buildings as they seized control of Germany. Now, the airfields of Regensburg are packed with aircraft of every shape and size, with scant fuel and supplies to do little more than defend their small swath of territory."
