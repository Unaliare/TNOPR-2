 esoteric_nazism_deep_ecology_nazism_subtype_noun:0 "Deep Ecology Nazism"
 esoteric_nazism_deep_ecology_nazism_subtype_desc: "The dove is white; nature is as it should be. Nature is not kind or accepting — it simply *is*. Nature is disciplined and thrifty, although in its own way peaceful, and no single human race inhabits it, just diffuse clades of human beings. Nothing is universal; everything first takes root in a place all its own. Ecology is the science of natural divisions. Ecology is the science of nations. Ecology is the science of the Fatherland.\n\nDeep Ecology Nazism is a strain of National Socialism born from the excesses of industrial warfare. Its first adherents witnessed the massacre of Aryan men in wars of aggression. They saw mercury seep into the soil and watched tanks press soldiers into the earth until man and mud mixed. War polluted the Aryan man and his living space. Deep Ecology Nazism offers a vision of a peaceful land where Aryans sing of overgrown tillage and high mountains which, like ribs of stone, remind the Volk of their oneness with the Fatherland. It is an ideology that attempts to offer a way to sustainably connect with the land as the Aryans' ancestors did, and its adherents solemnly pledge to defend that land with the tools of the Industrial Revolution if necessary.\n\nThe right state of nature is the absence of the foreign; the Aryan's land is his alone. There is no slavery in the Aryan's land because no subhumans still dwell there, as the natural order culled them long ago. There is no war in the Aryan's land because the Aryan already has his living space, his rightful land, the land of his forefathers. There is harmony and freedom in the Aryan land. There is oneness with nature and nation in the Aryan land. There is hope and optimism once more in the Aryan land." # an ecofascist when hes been living in a tent outside his house for 2 hours but then his mom calls him for dinner

 esoteric_nazism_burgundian_system_subtype_noun:0 "Burgundian System"
 esoteric_nazism_burgundian_system_subtype_desc: "When Germany's luck began running out after the Second World War, certain fanatical and unorthodox members of the Nazi Party - chief among them Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler - sought to reconcile their belief in the superiority of National Socialism with the increasingly bleak reality unfolding before them. They eventually arrived at the conclusion that the Nazi Party had lost sight of itself and collapsed into decadence, and that only they were fit to preserve National Socialism as truly intended. They quietly isolated themselves from the Third Reich's political structures, secretly building their own systems in parallel. When Himmler was made head of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgundy, he began implementing this purified vision of Nazism unimpeded.\n\nMuch like how many of the Reich's ideological goals revolve around Hitler's increasingly erratic statements, the tenets of the Burgundian System are rather ill-defined. The only way one could attempt to understand it is to analyze Himmler's increasingly inscrutable actions and cryptic beliefs, which range from vague and seemingly contradictory ideals of agrarianism and hyper-industrialization, to the establishment of a Germanic neopagan state religion and exploration of the occult. What is absolutely certain, though, is that his regime implements Nazi policies to a unique extreme: the SS is exalted above all other social strata, draconian racial hygiene laws are harshly enforced, and National Socialist theory is deliberately incorporated into every aspect of waking life. It also imposes an incomparable degree of totalitarianism upon the entire population, in hopes of removing all potential sources of decadence or complacency. Whether this has succeeded at all - or will do so in the future - is known only to Reichsführer Himmler, for while secrets flow like a river into the Ordensstaat, they are never permitted to leave."
 esoteric_nazism_imperial_cult_subtype:0 "Imperial Cult"
 esoteric_nazism_imperial_cult_subtype_noun:0 "Imperial Cult"
 esoteric_nazism_imperial_cult_subtype_desc: "On the night of 17 July 1918, Bolshevik revolutionaries executed the Romanov imperial family in a cellar beneath Yekaterinburg. Their deaths ought to have marked the end of the story of House Romanov. Instead, Russia remained haunted by them. Through revolution, war, and dissolution, rumors spread that one of Nicholas's children had survived. As the country shattered, some came to believe that the Romanov children remained in hiding and would return, one day, to restore Russia to greatness. These delusions came to coalesce around one man, Sergey Taboritsky, and his imperial cult of Alexei.\n\nA shambling corpse of a movement held together by fear, imperial nostalgia, and virulent antisemitism, the imperial cult's sole goal is to hasten Alexei's return to Russia. To this end, supporters believe in mobilizing all resources of the state toward purification, hoping for their savior's return once the Russian people have proved themselves "worthy" of him. Advocates support the systematic extermination of Russia's minorities, enforced poverty of the mass public, and the construction of grand, imperial monuments. Their system of mass surveillance and extreme punishment is directly inspired by the purified realms of the Reichskommissariat Kaukasien and its leader Josias, a man Taboritsky openly admires.\n\nYet, the movement's sustainability is unclear. Every day that their savior fails to return, the cult grows more desperate. Soon, observers fear, there may not be a Russia for Alexei to return to."
 esoteric_nazism_spartanism_subtype:0 "Spartanism"
 esoteric_nazism_spartanism_subtype_noun:0 "Spartanism"
 esoteric_nazism_spartanism_subtype_desc:0 "For some, National Socialism's success was forever enshrined by its triumph, and its failures were only due to specific misfortunes or political errors. They say that the Reich, for all its faults, is not in need of anything more than reform or rejuvenation. They would see the status quo continue in perpetuity, leaving Germany as, ultimately, just another empire.\n\nFor Reinhard Heydrich and his followers in the Deutsche-SS, that is not enough. It will never be enough.\n\nWhile the Himmlerites delved into esotericism, and the Waffen-SS betrayed their cause for wealth and power, Heydrich and his devotees already had a vision of their own, far different from that of the corrupt NSDAP and degenerate liberals. It was one of a better, simpler, more pure society of the ancient past, where men were warriors, women were mothers, and all traces of profligacy and weakness were excised. No cities bubbling with filth; no "pragmatic" mercy for subhumans. In barracks-towns and country estates, the pure race drilled for war and worked the land, while their progeny was honed to perfection through purges and bloodshed. They were the Spartans, espoused in thrilling tones by Heydrich as the ancient manifestation of Aryan supremacy - and when the world revolves upon the axis of Germany, even history itself will bend to the Führer's will.\n\nIt falls to the true believers of National Socialism - the SS - to realize the promised land. Infused with the spirit of Sparta and forged anew upon the anvil of the Volksgemeinschaft, the Reich will be made eternal. Even if the blood must flow in rivers and overtake the sea; if countless millions must choke and die; if the foundations of utopia are laid upon the mass grave of all mankind; it will be worth it. One has not the luxury of counting the cost."
 esoteric_nazism_agrarian_spartanism_subtype:0 "Agrarian Spartanism"
 esoteric_nazism_agrarian_spartanism_subtype_noun:0 "Agrarian Spartanism"
 esoteric_nazism_agrarian_spartanism_subtype_desc:0 "It is the nature of an ideology to adapt to its surroundings. The Burgundian System of Ordenstadt Pleskau is no exception. Birthed in the aftermath of the failed SS coup d'etat amid the ruins of Pskov, Pleskau's agrarian spartanism represents a rural, non-industrial take on Himmler's ultra-totalitarian racialism, an agricultural state ruled over by isolated and mad fanatics.\n\nLed by anti-urban, anti-industrial figures of the SS, Pleskau's agricultural spartan movement promotes a highly stratified, neo-feudal system. At its lowest rungs are the slaves, a population of hundreds of thousands of Russians forced to engage in back-breaking agricultural labor and prohibited from learning skills. These slaves are assigned to large estates managed by men of the SS, the nucleus of a new landed gentry, who are encouraged to think of the land as entirely theirs, connected to them by blood. While these men maintain iron fists over their property, their officers maintain iron fists over them, enforcing puritanical cultural standards and hardline traditionalism. Connections outside strict hierarchies are highly discouraged. Cities and urban settlements, seen as dens of degeneracy, exist only for administration or strategic purposes."

 esoteric_nazism_noun: "Esoteric Nazism"
 esoteric_nazism_subtype_desc: "Even before it became a continent-conquering force, National Socialism was far from a homogeneous movement defined by an orthodox line. From the highest echelons of power to the very bottom of the Party bureaucracy, commitment to state-espoused ideals was varied, especially at the individual level. Indeed, a skeptic might assess National Socialism as little more than an ill-brewed melange of cynical politics and the worst aspects of the German national character. In this view, the triumph of Nazism is little more than proof of a world run mad.\n\nHow narrow-minded. How foolish. How unenlightened.\n\nCertain privileged souls have found in the tenets of National Socialism an ethos to surpass all others - one which utterly annihilates existing truths and norms, thereby revealing the true path to utopia. For these true believers who have had the scales lifted from their eyes, nothing else matters anymore. Materialism, rationalism, morality - all revealed as transient illusions of a degenerate world ruled by sinister forces. Subhumans, and even many Aryans, are blind to this newly illuminated reality, but so long as the light of truth burns within a single uncorrupted heart, hope for the pure race endures. Let National Socialism unfurl its wings in glory, and follow it to whatever end, for it is the way, the light, and the truth. The means and the words matter not - only utopia."

 communist_stalinism_subtype_noun:0 "Stalinism"
 communist_stalinism_subtype_desc: "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin was one of many contenders to succeed Lenin as leader of the Soviet Union. While agreeing with Bukharin on the principle of "Socialism in One Country", he rejected the market-driven development of the New Economic Policy. Instead, he believed that the State should exercise total control over the economy to spur on rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. Private enterprise could never be trusted to develop a fully socialist state, and therefore all industry and agriculture ought to be collectivized and directed by Communist Party central planners to achieve the Union's goals. A key corollary to this policy is that, far from withering away after the revolution as the old Leninists believed, the State must indeed be strengthened a thousandfold in order to implement a full transition to a communist society. This was heresy to the likes of Bukharin, who would triumph over Stalin in the succession struggle after the latter perished in a tragic industrial accident.\n\nOnce thought vanquished, Stalin's ideas have been reborn in the West Siberian People's Republic. Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism has found its Apostle in Chairman Lazar Kaganovich, a formerly obscure Soviet official banished to the Urals by Bukharin before the war. He proclaims that Stalinist collectivized industrial development would have allowed Russia to outcompete German industry and push the Hun all the way back to Berlin. Yet, claims Chairman Kaganovich, Soviet Russia can still be restored to its former glory through following Stalin's insights; his most important insight being that the Soviet State must hold absolute power within its borders in order to triumph over its enemies: Hun, Kulak, Collaborator and Class Traitor alike."

 esoteric_nazism_jucheism_subtype_desc: "Jucheism, also known as Juche Idea，is the ideological system and theoretical foundation of the Workers' Party of Korea, founded by Kim Il Sung and systematized by Hwang Jang Yeol. They declared Jucheism to be distinctly different from Marxism-Leninism in the 1970s and further developed it later. made it an ideological break with Marxism-Leninism and raised the status of Kim Jong-un in Jucheism.\n\nJucheism has been criticized for its human rights situation, with an OFN survey reporting that "The gravity, scale and nature of Jucheism's human rights abuses are today rivaled only by those of the SS Order-State of Burgundy", and international human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, share a similar view.\n§VBut they'll never admit these allegations.§!"
