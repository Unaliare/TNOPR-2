 POLITICS_RUHOLLAH_KHOMEINI_DESC:0"Ruhollah Khomeini has lived in exile for more than a decade. His legend has only grown in this time. Unlike the Nazi-backed imperial junta and the American-backed 'democrats', Khomeini's base of support lies in the Iranian people, and his power in their desire to break the shackles of foreign oppression and live according to the Will of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\n\nKhomeini's vision for Iran is that of 'welayat-el faqih', with a group of learned Islamic jurists providing guardianship to the state. To his enemies' surprise the Ayatollah has proven a pragmatic man, making and breaking alliances with all manner of power centres as he sees fit. To his supporters, emboldened by cassette tapes carrying his message, Khomeini is anything and everything. To the religious he promises a return to Islamic values; to the nationalists, an end to the 'Jewish agents' and 'foreign serpents' backing their enemies. To the young, the Ayatollah promises hope and a better life. As for his own role in the Iranian Revolution, perhaps only God knows."
