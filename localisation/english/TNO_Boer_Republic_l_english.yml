 #Ideas
  BOR_disorganised_state: "Disorganised State"
  BOR_disorganised_state_desc: "While a Boer State has been born out of our revolt, it is in a very vulnerable state, and especially unprepared for a full scale war with South Africa. Our army is underequipped and untrained, our government is highly unstable and our South African enemies have air supremacy. We must solve these problems fast, lest we be subjugated by the South Africans."
  BOR_the_false_republic: "The False Republic"
  BOR_the_false_republic_desc: "Officially, our country is a republic. But things are quite different in reality. Currently, the /”republic/” is run by a small clique of Boer Nationalists, who work under support of the African Reichskommissariate. Our people dislike this fact, holding demonstrations and starting protests in an attempt to bring a true republic. We may well have to give in to their demands and reform our infant government for stability and victory."
  BOR_against_the_hardliner: "Against the Hardliner"
  BOR_against_the_hardliner_desc: "The biggest threat to our government are the Hardliners of the National Party. They seek to destroy our Republic and rebuild the Boer State in the image of the Germans back in Europe. They are now even beginning to politicise our army, influencing our soldiers, officers and generals, to bring them to their sway for their cause. We must combat this by enforcing apoliticism in our army and dealing with the Hardliners, or else, they may become too powerful and bring down our state into a civil war."
