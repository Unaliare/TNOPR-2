PRC_CountryInfo_Folder.101: "The Collapse"
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content.1: "Regroup on the Steppe"
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "In the wake of the West Russian War and the West Russian Revolutionary Front's collapse, Aleksandr Vasilevsky organized the retreat from the Mozhaisk Line. After this defeat Vasilevsky took up the task ensuring the Red Army would survive, no matter what. Gathering all the men that would follow him, Vasilevsky set out to regroup on the Mongolian steppe where the Luftwaffe could not reach them. There Vasilevsky hoped to regroup on the steppe, pushing out from the East to the West. His aim was to avoid the food scarcity and bombing that those who went north with Yegorov suffer now. Unfortunately, the Imperial Japanese Army was advancing upon these lands already."
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content.2: "An Uneasy Alliance"
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "With their collaborators, the Japanese Imperialists would claim all of Mongolia. Would the Red Army abandon the Mongolian people to exploitation and deprivation? Could Vasilevsky rejoin with his brethren in the WRRF if he did so? An uneasy alliance was made with the remnants of the Mongolian Army, the Mongolian and Tuvan people. All would be treated equal by the Red Army, but the Red Army would have primacy over all else. This was the era of warlords and there could be no other compromise in this regard."
 PRC_CountryInfo_Folder.102: "The Restoration"
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content.3: "End Stagnation"
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "At first the bond of mutual destruction by Imperialists, a mad king, a rogue army, and the madman exploiting Bukharin's legitimacy for his paranoid insanity kept the Revolutionary Council united in purpose. Tensions mount as opportunities now arise to end this period of stagnation. Therefore, the Revolutionary Council has its attention drawn in two directions. The Russians, made up entirely of Red Army veterans, wish to return to their homeland and restore the Soviet order upon the warlords. The Mongolians, who hold solidarity with the Tuvans, desire to push against the puppets of the Sphere. They sense weakness now that Mengjiang is torn apart in open rebellion and see this as the perfect opportunity to unite the nation. If Vasilevsky is to keep the Council whole he must navigate the desires of both groups."
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content.4: "WE ARE UNCOUNQERABLE！"
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "It will be no easy task. The Russians and Mongolians are both proud peoples. And they have every right to be, for we are unconquered. We are unconquerable! Let us proceed forward, as not a collection of separate peoples, but as a Soviet people!"
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content.5: "§G==FEATURES==§!"
 PRC_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "- Maintain the interests of the Russian, Mongolian, and Tuvan people. Favor a slow approach or rapid conquest?\n\n- With the legacy of Bukharin's Siberian plan and some of the architects of it, rebuild industry to equip the Red Army with modern weaponry.\n\n- When and how should the Army become subordinate to the citizens of the Council? Should it at all until Russia is made whole once again?"
